    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Linear search**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search), also known as\n",
    "sequential search, is a fundamental algorithm in the field of computer science,\n",
    "serving as a bedrock for understanding more complex algorithms. It represents\n",
    "the most _intuitive_ method of searching for an element within a list. The\n",
    "simplicity of linear search lies in its straightforward approach: examining each\n",
    "element in the list **_sequentially_** until the desired element is found or the\n",
    "end of the list is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm, in its essence, begins with the assumption of an **unordered**\n",
    "list. Without any prior knowledge of the arrangement of elements, linear search\n",
    "treats each item in the list with **equal importance**, methodically checking\n",
    "each until a match is found. This aspect of linear search, while simple, is\n",
    "crucial in understanding how more complex searching algorithms evolve and\n",
    "optimize under different conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "As we progress from the basic unordered scenario, the concept of an ordered list\n",
    "introduces a subtle yet significant shift in the algorithmâ€™s operation. In an\n",
    "ordered list, the elements are arranged in a known sequence, either ascending or\n",
    "descending. This arrangement allows for certain optimizations in the search\n",
    "process. For instance, the search can be terminated early if the current element\n",
    "in the sequence is greater (or lesser, depending on the order) than the element\n",
    "being searched for, as it confirms the absence of the target element in the\n",
    "remaining part of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, exploring the concept of a probabilistic array adds another\n",
    "dimension to our understanding of linear search. In a probabilistic setting,\n",
    "each element's likelihood of being the target is different and known. This\n",
    "knowledge can be leveraged to modify the traditional linear search into a more\n",
    "efficient version, where the order of search is determined based on the\n",
    "probability of finding the target element, thus potentially reducing the average\n",
    "number of comparisons needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The **linear search** algorithm operates on a fundamental principle of\n",
    "_sequential access_ in data structures. This intuition is best understood by\n",
    "considering the data structure it commonly operates on, such as a\n",
    "[list](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)>). In computer\n",
    "science, the representation of a list in memory is typically implemented as a\n",
    "linear data structure. This means that the elements of the list are stored in\n",
    "[**contiguous**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(computing)>)\n",
    "memory locations. Each element in the list is stored at a memory address that\n",
    "sequentially follows the previous element, adhering to a defined order. Although\n",
    "not strictly relevant to the algorithm, having spatial locality between elements\n",
    "in the list enables efficient access and traversal operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To elucidate the mechanism of linear search, let's consider the task of locating\n",
    "a specific target element $\\tau$ within a list $\\mathcal{A}$. The process\n",
    "unfolds in a _sequential manner_: beginning with the first element, the\n",
    "algorithm examines each subsequent element in turn. This _sequential traversal_\n",
    "is the hallmark of linear search, distinguishing it from more complex search\n",
    "algorithms that may jump or divide the list in their search process.\n",

    "target $\\tau$ or exhausts the search space. Consequently, we will just\n",
    "interchangeably use the array $\\mathcal{A}$ as the search space $\\mathcal{S}$.\n",

    "   1. Set the initial index $n = 0$.\n",
    "\n",

    "or reach a particular state. Let $\\mathcal{P}(n)$ be a property (loop invariant)\n",
    "related to the loop's index $n$ or the state of the computation at the start of\n",
    "each iteration. The loop invariant must satisfy the following conditions to\n",
    "prove the correctness of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Before the first iteration of the loop, $\\mathcal{P}(n)$\n",

    "between the two methods and how they relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mathematical Induction\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical induction typically includes two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case**: Show that a statement or property is true for the initial\n",
    "   value, usually for $n = 0$ or $n = 1$.\n",

    "   true for $n=k + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conclusion**: Since the base case and inductive step are proven, the\n",
    "   statement is true for all natural numbers starting from the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Loop Invariant and Induction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's align this with the loop invariant steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization (Base Case in Induction)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In loop invariants: You show that $\\mathcal{P}(n)$ is true before the\n",
    "      first iteration of the loop, where $n$ is at its initial value.\n",
    "    - In induction: This is analogous to proving the base case, where you show\n",
    "      that the property holds for the initial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintenance (Inductive Step in Induction)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In loop invariants: Assuming $\\mathcal{P}(k)$ is true at the start of the\n",
    "      $k^{th}$ iteration, you must show that $\\mathcal{P}(k+1)$ is true at the\n",
    "      end of the $k^{th}$ iteration. This is the same as showing that\n",
    "      $\\mathcal{P}(k+1)$ is true at the start of the $(k+1)^{th}$ iteration.\n",
    "      This is done by examining the changes made in the loop body and how they\n",
    "      affect $\\mathcal{P}(n)$.\n",
    "    - In induction: This directly corresponds to the inductive step where you\n",
    "      assume the statement is true for $k$ and prove it for $k+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination**:\n",
    "    - In loop invariants: When the loop terminates, the invariant\n",
    "      $\\mathcal{P}(n)$ along with the termination condition helps in\n",
    "      establishing the correctness of the algorithm. This corresponds to\n",
    "      concluding in induction that since the base case and inductive step are\n",
    "      proven, the property holds for all natural numbers starting from the base\n",
    "      case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the process of using a loop invariant to prove the correctness of an\n",
    "algorithm can be viewed as an application of simple mathematical induction. The\n",
    "initialization step corresponds to the base case in induction, and the\n",
    "maintenance step corresponds to the inductive step. This relationship highlights\n",

    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Before the first iteration (when $n = 0$), the subarray\n",
    "     $\\mathcal{A}[0..n-1]$ is empty. Therefore, the statement that $\\tau$ is not\n",
    "     in $\\mathcal{A}[0..n-1]$ is trivially true, satisfying the initialization\n",
    "     condition of the loop invariant. This is the\n",
    "     [**vacuous truth**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth) case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintenance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Assume that the loop invariant holds true at the beginning of the\n",
    "     $n=k^{th}$ iteration, this implies that $\\tau$ is not in\n",
    "     $\\mathcal{A}[0..k-1]$.\n",
    "   - If $\\mathcal{A}[k] \\neq \\tau$, then $n$ increments to $n=k+1$, and now the\n",
    "     subarray $\\mathcal{A}[0..(k+1)-1] = \\mathcal{A}[0..k]$ does not contain\n",
    "     $\\tau$. Thus, the invariant that $\\tau$ is not in $\\mathcal{A}[0..n-1]$ is\n",
    "     maintained for the next iteration (note now $n=k+1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm terminates under two conditions:\n",
    "     - If $\\mathcal{A}[n] = \\tau$ at any iteration, the algorithm successfully\n",
    "       terminates, returning the index $n$. This indicates $\\tau$ was found in\n",
    "       the remaining search space.\n",
    "     - If the algorithm exhausts the search space $\\mathcal{S}$ without finding\n",
    "       $\\tau$ (i.e., $n \\geq N$), it concludes that $\\tau$ is not present in\n",
    "       $\\mathcal{A}$ and terminates, returning $-1$. This is consistent with the\n",
    "       loop invariant, as the invariant implies $\\tau$ is not in the searched\n",
    "       portion of $\\mathcal{A}$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof focuses on the maintenance of the invariant and the termination\n",
    "conditions, ensuring that the algorithm is both correct (it will find $\\tau$ if\n",
    "it is present) and finite (it will terminate after a finite number of steps\n",
    "regardless of the outcome).\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is quite simple, every time before we start the next iteration, we\n",
    "need to ensure that the target element $\\tau$ is not in the subarray we have\n",
    "searched so far. If $\\tau$ is not in the subarray, then we can safely move on to\n",
    "the next iteration. If we cannot assume such invariance, then we cannot be sure\n",
    "that we have exhaustively and correctly searched the portion of the list already\n",
    "examined.\n",
    "\n",
    "This invariance is crucial for the correctness of the algorithm. Without this\n",
    "assurance, there is a possibility that $\\tau$ was already present in the part of\n",
    "$\\mathcal{A}$ that has been searched, and moving to the next iteration would\n",
    "mean potentially overlooking the target. Therefore, maintaining this invariant\n",
    "at each step ensures that if $\\tau$ is indeed in the list, it will be found in\n",
    "the remaining unsearched part of $\\mathcal{A}$.\n",

    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to split the time complexity into a few cases, this is because the time\n",
    "complexity **_heavily_** depends on the position of the target element we are\n",
    "searching for.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first establish the time complexity function $\\mathcal{T}(N)$ to represent\n",
    "the exact number of operations (comparisons) an algorithm performs for a given\n",
    "input size $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of linear search, the time complexity function $\\mathcal{T}(N)$ is\n",
    "defined as the exact number of comparisons needed to find the target element\n",
    "$\\tau$ in a list $\\mathcal{A}$ of size $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Case\n",
    "\n",
    "If the element we are searching for is at the beginning of the list, then $\\tau$\n",
    "is at the first index of $\\mathcal{A}$, and the algorithm terminates after\n",
    "performing only one comparison. Therefore, $\\mathcal{T}(N) = 1$. Consequently,\n",
    "the time complexity of the best case is in the order of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Worst Case\n",
    "\n",
    "If the element is at the end of the list, then the time complexity is in the\n",
    "order of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, because we need to check every element in the list\n",
    "($\\mathcal{T}(N) = N$).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Average Case\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, the time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right)$. This\n",
    "average means that for a list with $N$ elements, there is an equal chance that\n",
    "the element we are searching for is at the beginning, middle, or end of the\n",
    "list. In short, it is a uniform distribution. And therefore the **expected**\n",
    "time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right)$. Let's define it more\n",
    "rigorously below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defining the Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In the context of linear search, the random variable $X$ can be defined as\n",
    "    the index position at which the target element $\\tau$ is located in the\n",
    "    array $\\mathcal{A}$.\n",
    "-   This means $X$ takes on values in the set $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, N-1\\}$, where\n",
    "    $N$ is the size of the array and indexed by $n=0, 1, 2, \\ldots, N-1$.\n",
    "-   We denote $X = n$ as the realization that the target element $\\tau$ is at\n",
    "    the $n$-th position in the array and $\\mathbb{P}[X = n]$ as the probability\n",
    "    of this event occurring. In other words, if $X = 2$, then\n",
    "    $\\mathbb{P}[X = 2]$ is the probability that the target element $\\tau$ is at\n",
    "    the $2$-nd position in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Uniform Distribution of $X$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   When we say that $X$ is uniformly distributed, we mean that the probability\n",
    "    of the target element $\\tau$ being at any specific index $N$ in the array is\n",
    "    equal for all indices.\n",
    "-   Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\mathbb{P}[X = n] = \\frac{1}{N}$ for\n",
    "    all $i$ in $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, N-1\\}$.\n",
    "-   This is based on the assumption that the target element $\\tau$ is equally\n",
    "    likely to be at any position in the array, reflecting a scenario where there\n",
    "    is no prior knowledge about the position of $\\tau$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Calculating Expected Value $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{T}(N)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculating Expected Value of $X$**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The expected value (average) of $X$, denoted as $\\mathbb{E}[X]$,\n",
    "      represents the average index position where $\\tau$ is expected to be\n",
    "      found.\n",
    "    - It is computed as the sum of each possible value of $X$ multiplied by its\n",
    "      probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "        \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "        \\mathbb{E}[X]  &= \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n \\cdot P(X = n) \\\\\n",
    "                       &= \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n \\cdot \\frac{1}{N} \\\\\n",
    "                       &= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n \\\\\n",
    "                       &= \\frac{1}{N} \\cdot \\frac{N(N+1)}{2} \\\\\n",
    "                       &= \\frac{N+1}{2}\n",
    "        \\end{aligned}\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In other words, the expected value of $X$ is $\\frac{N+1}{2}$, which means\n",
    "      that on average, the target element $\\tau$ is expected to be found around\n",
    "      the middle of the array. This translates to\n",
    "      $\\mathcal{T}(N) = \\frac{N+1}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "        Because the average number of comparisons is $\\frac{N+1}{2}$, and each\n",
    "        comparison takes constant time, the average time complexity is also\n",
    "        $\\frac{N+1}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relating $\\mathbb{E}[X]$ to Time Complexity $\\mathcal{T}(N)$**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The time complexity function $\\mathcal{T}(N)$ represents the number of\n",
    "      comparisons required to find $\\tau$ in the array $\\mathcal{A}$.\n",
    "    - When the linear search algorithm finds $\\tau$ at index $0 < n <= N$, it\n",
    "      performs $n + 1$ comparisons (since the first comparison is at index 0).\n",
    "    - Thus, the function $\\mathcal{T}(n) = n + 1$, where $n$ is the index at\n",
    "      which $\\tau$ is found.\n",
    "    - To determine the expected time complexity $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{T}(N)]$, we\n",
    "      need to consider the expected number of comparisons, which depends on the\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Definition of Big O Notation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Big O notation provides an upper bound on the growth rate of a function.\n",
    "      In the context of time complexity, it is used to describe the worst-case\n",
    "      scenario for the growth rate of the number of operations an algorithm\n",
    "      performs.\n",
    "    - Formally, a function $f(N)$ is in $\\mathcal{O}(g(N))$ if there exist\n",

    "      $0 \\leq f(N) \\leq C \\cdot g(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Applying to Linear Search**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - From the earlier analysis, we have that the average number of comparisons\n",
    "      needed to find $\\tau$ is $\\frac{N+3}{2}$.\n",
    "    - To express this in Big O notation, we need to find a function $g(N)$ and\n",
    "      constants $C$ and $N_0$ that satisfy the formal definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choosing $g(N)$ and Constants**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Let's choose $g(N) = N$. This choice reflects the linear nature of the\n",
    "      time complexity function $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{T}(N)]$.\n",
    "    - Now, we need to find $C$ and $N_0$ such that\n",
    "      $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{T}(N)] \\leq C \\cdot g(N)$ for all $N \\geq N_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Proof**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We note that $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{T}(N)] = \\frac{N+3}{2}$.\n",
    "    - Choose $C = 1$ and $N_0 = 1$. For all $N \\geq N_0$:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case - Empty Container**: Checks if the container is empty. If so,\n",
    "   returns `-1`, indicating the target is not found.\n",
    "2. **Base Case - Target Found**: Checks if the first element in the container is\n",
    "   the target. If so, returns the current index.\n",
    "3. **Recursive Case**: Calls itself with the rest of the container (excluding\n",
    "   the first element) and increments the index.\n",

    "conclude that the target is not in the list. This early termination is a\n",
    "game-changer in terms of efficiency, particularly when the target is located\n",

    "### Probabilistic Search: Harnessing Data to Optimize Searches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**: Probabilistic search represents a significant advancement in\n",
    "search algorithms by incorporating the likelihood of each element being the\n",
    "target into the search process. This method is particularly useful in situations\n",
    "where certain elements are more frequently searched for than others, a common\n",
    "scenario in many real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Power of Probability**: In probabilistic search, each element in the array\n",
    "is assigned a probability based on its likelihood of being the target, derived\n",
    "from historical data or specific characteristics. The search algorithm then\n",
    "prioritizes elements with higher probabilities, leading to a more efficient\n",
    "search process. This approach is ideal for datasets where user behavior or\n",
    "element popularity can be predicted or measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications and Benefits**: From online shopping platforms optimizing product\n",
    "searches based on buying patterns to search engines prioritizing frequently\n",
    "queried terms, probabilistic search has wide-ranging applications. Its adoption\n",
    "can significantly enhance user experience by reducing search times and improving\n",

    "#### Problem Scenario: Optimized Product Search in an Online Store\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "An online store, \"TechGear\", sells a variety of electronic products. Based on\n",
    "historical sales data, some products are more frequently searched for by\n",
    "customers than others. TechGear wants to optimize their product search algorithm\n",
    "to quickly locate products that customers are more likely to search for.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sales Data and Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "TechGear has the following catalog of products with associated probabilities\n",
    "based on their sales data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Product ID | Product Name     | Probability (Sales-based) |\n",
    "| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |\n",
    "| 1          | Smartphone X     | 0.30                      |\n",
    "| 2          | Laptop Pro       | 0.25                      |\n",
    "| 3          | Headphones Beat  | 0.15                      |\n",
    "| 4          | Smartwatch 2     | 0.10                      |\n",
    "| 5          | Camera Zoom      | 0.05                      |\n",
    "| 6          | Portable Charger | 0.05                      |\n",
    "| 7          | Drone Fly        | 0.05                      |\n",
    "| 8          | Gaming Console Z | 0.05                      |\n",
    "\n",
    "The probabilities reflect the likelihood of each product being searched for,\n",
    "based on past customer behavior. For instance, 'Smartphone X' has the highest\n",
    "search probability at 0.30.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "TechGear wants to implement a linear search algorithm that utilizes this\n",
    "probability data to improve the efficiency of product searches in their catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Search Algorithm Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reorder the Catalog**: The first step is to reorder the catalog of products\n",
    "   based on the probabilities, placing higher probability items towards the\n",
    "   beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Search Process**: Implement a linear search that goes through the reordered\n",
    "   list. If a customer searches for 'Smartwatch 2', the algorithm will check\n",
    "   products in the order of their likelihood (starting with 'Smartphone X', then\n",
    "   'Laptop Pro', and so on) until it finds 'Smartwatch 2'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate Performance**: The performance of this probabilistic search\n",
    "   algorithm can be compared with a regular linear search to demonstrate the\n",
    "   efficiency gained by prioritizing products based on their search probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Expected Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation is that, on average, the probabilistic search algorithm will\n",
    "locate products faster than a regular linear search, especially for items with\n",
    "high search probabilities. This approach can significantly improve customer\n",
    "experience by reducing search times. Intuitively, it makes sense, because\n",
    "customers are more likely to search for products with higher probabilities, and\n",
    "the algorithm prioritizes these items.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while linear search is one of the simplest search algorithms, its\n",
    "variations like ordered and probabilistic searches demonstrate its adaptability\n",
    "and effectiveness in diverse scenarios. From basic implementations in unordered\n",
    "lists to more sophisticated applications in sorted and probabilistic lists,\n",
    "linear search remains a crucial tool in the algorithmic toolkit. It is also a\n",
    "good \"naive/brute-force\" approach to solving problems.\n",
