    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Linear search**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search), also known as\n",
    "sequential search, is a fundamental algorithm in the field of computer science,\n",
    "serving as a bedrock for understanding more complex algorithms. It represents\n",
    "the most _intuitive_ method of searching for an element within a list. The\n",
    "simplicity of linear search lies in its straightforward approach: examining each\n",
    "element in the list **_sequentially_** until the desired element is found or the\n",
    "end of the list is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm, in its essence, begins with the assumption of an **unordered**\n",
    "list. Without any prior knowledge of the arrangement of elements, linear search\n",
    "treats each item in the list with **equal importance**, methodically checking\n",
    "each until a match is found. This aspect of linear search, while simple, is\n",
    "crucial in understanding how more complex searching algorithms evolve and\n",
    "optimize under different conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "As we progress from the basic unordered scenario, the concept of an ordered list\n",
    "introduces a subtle yet significant shift in the algorithm’s operation. In an\n",
    "ordered list, the elements are arranged in a known sequence, either ascending or\n",
    "descending. This arrangement allows for certain optimizations in the search\n",
    "process. For instance, the search can be terminated early if the current element\n",
    "in the sequence is greater (or lesser, depending on the order) than the element\n",
    "being searched for, as it confirms the absence of the target element in the\n",
    "remaining part of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, exploring the concept of a probabilistic array adds another\n",
    "dimension to our understanding of linear search. In a probabilistic setting,\n",
    "each element's likelihood of being the target is different and known. This\n",
    "knowledge can be leveraged to modify the traditional linear search into a more\n",
    "efficient version, where the order of search is determined based on the\n",
    "probability of finding the target element, thus potentially reducing the average\n",
    "number of comparisons needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The **linear search** algorithm operates on a fundamental principle of\n",
    "_sequential access_ in data structures. This intuition is best understood by\n",
    "considering the data structure it commonly operates on, such as a\n",
    "[list](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)>). In computer\n",
    "science, the representation of a list in memory is typically implemented as a\n",
    "linear data structure. This means that the elements of the list are stored in\n",
    "[**contiguous**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(computing)>)\n",
    "memory locations. Each element in the list is stored at a memory address that\n",
    "sequentially follows the previous element, adhering to a defined order. Although\n",
    "not strictly relevant to the algorithm, having spatial locality between elements\n",
    "in the list enables efficient access and traversal operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To elucidate the mechanism of linear search, let's consider the task of locating\n",
    "a specific target element $\\tau$ within a list $\\mathcal{A}$. The process\n",
    "unfolds in a _sequential manner_: beginning with the first element, the\n",
    "algorithm examines each subsequent element in turn. This _sequential traversal_\n",
    "is the hallmark of linear search, distinguishing it from more complex search\n",
    "algorithms that may jump or divide the list in their search process.\n",

    "of mathematical induction (specifically, simple induction) involves drawing\n",
    "parallels between the steps of the loop invariant method and the steps of simple\n",
    "mathematical induction. In what follows, we will examine the similarities\n",
    "between the two methods and how they relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mathematical Induction\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical induction typically includes two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case**: Show that a statement or property is true for the initial\n",
    "   value, usually for $n = 0$ or $n = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement is true for some arbitrary natural\n",
    "   number $n=k$ (this is the induction hypothesis), and then prove that it's\n",
    "   true for $n=k + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conclusion**: Since the base case and inductive step are proven, the\n",
    "   statement is true for all natural numbers starting from the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Loop Invariant and Induction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's align this with the loop invariant steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization (Base Case in Induction)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In loop invariants: You show that $\\mathcal{P}(n)$ is true before the first\n",
    "     iteration of the loop, where $n$ is at its initial value.\n",
    "   - In induction: This is analogous to proving the base case, where you show\n",
    "     that the property holds for the initial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintenance (Inductive Step in Induction)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In loop invariants: Assuming $\\mathcal{P}(k)$ is true at the start of the\n",
    "     $k^{th}$ iteration, you must show that $\\mathcal{P}(k+1)$ is true at the\n",
    "     end of the $k^{th}$ iteration. This is the same as showing that\n",
    "     $\\mathcal{P}(k+1)$ is true at the start of the $(k+1)^{th}$ iteration. This\n",
    "     is done by examining the changes made in the loop body and how they affect\n",
    "     $\\mathcal{P}(n)$.\n",
    "   - In induction: This directly corresponds to the inductive step where you\n",
    "     assume the statement is true for $k$ and prove it for $k+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - In loop invariants: When the loop terminates, the invariant\n",
    "     $\\mathcal{P}(n)$ along with the termination condition helps in establishing\n",
    "     the correctness of the algorithm. This corresponds to concluding in\n",
    "     induction that since the base case and inductive step are proven, the\n",
    "     property holds for all natural numbers starting from the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the process of using a loop invariant to prove the correctness of an\n",
    "algorithm can be viewed as an application of simple mathematical induction. The\n",
    "initialization step corresponds to the base case in induction, and the\n",
    "maintenance step corresponds to the inductive step. This relationship highlights\n",
    "the fundamental role that mathematical induction plays in formal reasoning about\n",
    "algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be an array of $N$ elements,\n",
    "$\\mathcal{A}[0], \\mathcal{A}[1], \\ldots, \\mathcal{A}[N-1]$, and let $\\tau$ be a\n",
    "target value. Consider a loop in an algorithm that iterates over $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
    "with the intention of finding the index of $\\tau$ in $\\mathcal{A}$. The loop\n",
    "invariant for this algorithm can be stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:proof}\n",
    "We first define the **Loop Invariant** as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the invariant as: At the start of each iteration, the target element\n",
    "$\\tau$ is not in the subset of the list $\\mathcal{A}[0..n-1]$, where $n$ is the\n",
    "current index. This implies that if $\\tau$ is in the list, it must be in the\n",
    "remaining part $\\mathcal{A}[n..N-1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop invariant must satisfy three conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Before the first iteration (when $n = 0$), the subarray\n",
    "     $\\mathcal{A}[0..n-1]$ is empty. Therefore, the statement that $\\tau$ is not\n",
    "     in $\\mathcal{A}[0..n-1]$ is trivially true, satisfying the initialization\n",
    "     condition of the loop invariant. This is the\n",
    "     [**vacuous truth**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth) case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintenance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Assume that the loop invariant holds true at the beginning of the\n",
    "     $n=k^{th}$ iteration, this implies that $\\tau$ is not in\n",
    "     $\\mathcal{A}[0..k-1]$.\n",
    "   - If $\\mathcal{A}[k] \\neq \\tau$, then $n$ increments to $n=k+1$, and now the\n",
    "     subarray $\\mathcal{A}[0..(k+1)-1] = \\mathcal{A}[0..k]$ does not contain\n",
    "     $\\tau$. Thus, the invariant that $\\tau$ is not in $\\mathcal{A}[0..n-1]$ is\n",
    "     maintained for the next iteration (note now $n=k+1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm terminates under two conditions:\n",
    "     - If $\\mathcal{A}[n] = \\tau$ at any iteration, the algorithm successfully\n",
    "       terminates, returning the index $n$. This indicates $\\tau$ was found in\n",
    "       the remaining search space.\n",
    "     - If the algorithm exhausts the search space $\\mathcal{S}$ without finding\n",
    "       $\\tau$ (i.e., $n \\geq N$), it concludes that $\\tau$ is not present in\n",

    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to split the time complexity into a few cases, this is because the time\n",
    "complexity **_heavily_** depends on the position of the target element we are\n",
    "searching for.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first establish the time complexity function $\\mathcal{T}(N)$ to represent\n",
    "the exact number of operations (comparisons) an algorithm performs for a given\n",
    "input size $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of linear search, the time complexity function $\\mathcal{T}(N)$ is\n",
    "defined as the exact number of comparisons needed to find the target element\n",
    "$\\tau$ in a list $\\mathcal{A}$ of size $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Case\n",
    "\n",
    "If the element we are searching for is at the beginning of the list, then $\\tau$\n",
    "is at the first index of $\\mathcal{A}$, and the algorithm terminates after\n",
    "performing only one comparison. Therefore, $\\mathcal{T}(N) = 1$. Consequently,\n",
    "the time complexity of the best case is in the order of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Worst Case\n",
    "\n",
    "If the element is at the end of the list, then the time complexity is in the\n",
    "order of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, because we need to check every element in the list\n",
    "($\\mathcal{T}(N) = N$).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Average Case\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, the time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right)$. This\n",
    "average means that for a list with $N$ elements, there is an equal chance that\n",
    "the element we are searching for is at the beginning, middle, or end of the\n",
    "list. In short, it is a uniform distribution. And therefore the **expected**\n",
    "time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right)$. Let's define it more\n",
    "rigorously below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defining the Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the context of linear search, the random variable $X$ can be defined as the\n",
    "  index position at which the target element $\\tau$ is located in the array\n",
    "  $\\mathcal{A}$.\n",
    "- This means $X$ takes on values in the set $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, N-1\\}$, where\n",
    "  $N$ is the size of the array and indexed by $n=0, 1, 2, \\ldots, N-1$.\n",
    "- We denote $X = n$ as the realization that the target element $\\tau$ is at the\n",
    "  $n$-th position in the array and $\\mathbb{P}[X = n]$ as the probability of\n",
    "  this event occurring. In other words, if $X = 2$, then $\\mathbb{P}[X = 2]$ is\n",
    "  the probability that the target element $\\tau$ is at the $2$-nd position in\n",
    "  the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Uniform Distribution of $X$\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we say that $X$ is uniformly distributed, we mean that the probability of\n",
    "  the target element $\\tau$ being at any specific index $N$ in the array is\n",
    "  equal for all indices.\n",
    "- Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\mathbb{P}[X = n] = \\frac{1}{N}$ for all\n",
    "  $i$ in $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, N-1\\}$.\n",
    "- This is based on the assumption that the target element $\\tau$ is equally\n",
    "  likely to be at any position in the array, reflecting a scenario where there\n",
    "  is no prior knowledge about the position of $\\tau$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Calculating Expected Value $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{T}(N)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculating Expected Value of $X$**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The expected value (average) of $X$, denoted as $\\mathbb{E}[X]$, represents\n",
    "     the average index position where $\\tau$ is expected to be found.\n",
    "   - It is computed as the sum of each possible value of $X$ multiplied by its\n",
    "     probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "     \\mathbb{E}[X]  &= \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n \\cdot P(X = n) \\\\\n",
    "                    &= \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n \\cdot \\frac{1}{N} \\\\\n",
    "                    &= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} n \\\\\n",
    "                    &= \\frac{1}{N} \\cdot \\frac{N(N+1)}{2} \\\\\n",
    "                    &= \\frac{N+1}{2}\n",
    "     \\end{aligned}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In other words, the expected value of $X$ is $\\frac{N+1}{2}$, which means\n",
    "     that on average, the target element $\\tau$ is expected to be found around\n",
    "     the middle of the array. This translates to\n",
    "     $\\mathcal{T}(N) = \\frac{N+1}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "     Because the average number of comparisons is $\\frac{N+1}{2}$, and each\n",
    "     comparison takes constant time, the average time complexity is also\n",
    "     $\\frac{N+1}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relating $\\mathbb{E}[X]$ to Time Complexity $\\mathcal{T}(N)$**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The time complexity function $\\mathcal{T}(N)$ represents the number of\n",
    "     comparisons required to find $\\tau$ in the array $\\mathcal{A}$.\n",
    "   - When the linear search algorithm finds $\\tau$ at index $n$, it performs\n",
    "     $n + 1$ comparisons (since the first comparison is at index 0).\n",
    "   - Thus, the function $\\mathcal{T}(n) = n + 1$, where $n$ is the index at\n",
    "     which $\\tau$ is found.\n",
    "   - To determine the expected time complexity $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{T}(N)]$, we\n",
    "     need to consider the expected number of comparisons, which depends on the\n",
    "     average position $\\mathbb{E}[X]$ where $\\tau$ is located:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "     \\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{T}(N)] &= \\mathbb{E}[X + 1] \\\\\n",
    "                                &= \\mathbb{E}[X] + 1 \\\\\n",
    "                                &= \\frac{N+1}{2} + 1 \\\\\n",
    "                                &= \\frac{N+3}{2}\n",
    "     \\end{aligned}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This result shows that on average, the linear search algorithm will perform\n",
    "     $\\frac{N+3}{2}$ comparisons to find $\\tau$ in an array of size $N$ under\n",
    "     the assumption of uniform distribution. Note that the $+1$ in the\n",
    "     expression $\\frac{N+1}{2} + 1$ accounts for the fact that the comparison\n",
    "     starts at index $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Time Complexity Using Big O Notation $\\mathcal{O}(g(N))$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition of Big O Notation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Big O notation provides an upper bound on the growth rate of a function. In\n",
    "     the context of time complexity, it is used to describe the worst-case\n",
    "     scenario for the growth rate of the number of operations an algorithm\n",
    "     performs.\n",
    "   - Formally, a function $f(N)$ is in $\\mathcal{O}(g(N))$ if there exist\n",
    "     constants $C > 0$ and $N_0$ such that for all $N \\geq N_0$,\n",
    "     $0 \\leq f(N) \\leq C \\cdot g(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Applying to Linear Search**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - From the earlier analysis, we have that the average number of comparisons\n",
    "     needed to find $\\tau$ is $\\frac{N+3}{2}$.\n",
    "   - To express this in Big O notation, we need to find a function $g(N)$ and\n",
    "     constants $C$ and $N_0$ that satisfy the formal definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choosing $g(N)$ and Constants**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Let's choose $g(N) = N$. This choice reflects the linear nature of the time\n",
    "     complexity function $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{T}(N)]$.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - We note that $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{T}(N)] = \\frac{N+3}{2}$.\n",

    "                                        &= C \\cdot g(N)\n",

    "     $$\n",

    "- **Definition**: Input space complexity refers to the space used by the inputs\n",
    "  to the algorithm.\n",
    "- **Linear Search Context**: For linear search, the primary input is the list\n",
    "  $\\mathcal{A}$ of size $N$.\n",
    "- **Analysis**: Since the list $\\mathcal{A}$ is an essential input to the\n",
    "  algorithm and occupies space proportional to its size, the input space\n",

    "- **Space Complexity**: Thus, the input space complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(N)$,\n",
    "  where $N$ is the number of elements in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Auxiliary Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Auxiliary space complexity accounts for the extra or temporary\n",
    "  space used by an algorithm, excluding the space taken by the inputs.\n",
    "- **Linear Search Context**: In linear search, the only additional space used is\n",
    "  for a few variables, such as the index variable (and possibly a boolean flag).\n",
    "- **Analysis**: The space required for these variables does not scale with the\n",
    "  size of the input $N$; rather, it remains constant.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: Therefore, the auxiliary space complexity for linear\n",

    "#### Total Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Total space complexity combines both the input and auxiliary\n",
    "  space complexities.\n",
    "- **Linear Search Context**: The total space used by the algorithm includes the\n",

    "### The Recursive Counterpart\n",
    "\n",
    "After discussing the iterative approach, let's consider the recursive\n",
    "implementation of the unordered linear search. Recursion offers an alternative\n",
    "way to perform the search by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recursive Method Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `unordered_sequential_search_recursive` function implements linear search on\n",
    "an unordered sequence using recursion. It checks each element in sequence,\n",
    "starting from the beginning of the list, and returns the index of the target\n",
    "element if found. If the target is not found, it returns `-1`. This is achieved\n",
    "through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case - Empty Container**: Checks if the container is empty. If so,\n",
    "   returns `-1`, indicating the target is not found.\n",
    "2. **Base Case - Target Found**: Checks if the first element in the container is\n",
    "   the target. If so, returns the current index.\n",
    "3. **Recursive Case**: Calls itself with the rest of the container (excluding\n",
    "   the first element) and increments the index.\n",
    "\n",
