    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `N` piles of bananas, the `n-th` pile has\n",
    "piles `piles[n]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses\n",
    "some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less\n",
    "than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas\n",
    "during this hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before\n",

    "\n",
    "Return the _minimum_ integer `k` such that she can eat all the bananas within\n",
    "`h` hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Foundations and Practical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Koko Eating Bananas** problem serves as a captivating example of\n",
    "[optimization problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem) in\n",
    "computer science. At a high level, it tackles the challenge of resource\n",
    "allocation under time constraints. The narrative may involve a monkey and her\n",
    "bananas, but the core issue is universally relatable: _how to perform a set of\n",
    "tasks in the most efficient manner possible given limited time?_\n",
    "\n",
    "If we peel back the layers of this seemingly whimsical problem, we find a\n",
    "scenario not unlike those encountered in areas like _network bandwidth\n",
    "optimization_,\n",
    "[job scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_shop_scheduling) in\n",
    "multi-core processors, or even time-management strategies in day-to-day\n",
    "activities. The bananas can be thought of as data packets needing to be\n",
    "processed, and Koko's eating speed is akin to a processor's clock speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For readers interested in broader contexts, this problem can be viewed as a\n",
    "specific case within\n",
    "[combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization)\n",
    "and [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory). Both are\n",
    "fields that provide general frameworks for making optimal choices from a finite\n",
    "set of possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this problem doesn't just offer a method for optimizing a peculiar\n",
    "banana-eating scenario. It provides a framework for tackling a wide range of\n",
    "real-world optimization challenges. Thus, understanding its solution has both\n",
    "_theoretical_ and _practical_ significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogy: Job Scheduling in Data Centers\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a **[data center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center)** where\n",
    "multiple tasks (akin to the piles of bananas `piles`) need to be processed by a\n",
    "single server (akin to Koko). The task of the data center manager (akin to the\n",
    "algorithm `minEatingSpeed` you're trying to design) is to determine the\n",
    "**minimum processing power** (_speed_ `k`) each server must have to complete all\n",
    "tasks within a prescribed time frame (_hours_ `h`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breaking it Down\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tasks in Data Center**: These are equivalent to the piles of bananas. Each\n",
    "   task could require different amounts of processing, just as piles can have\n",
    "   different numbers of bananas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processing Power of the Server**: This is akin to the _speed_ $k$ at which\n",
    "   Koko eats bananas. The faster the processing power, the quicker the tasks get\n",
    "   done.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Frame**: Just as Koko has a deadline $h$, the data center has a\n",
    "   _service level agreement_\n",
    "   ([SLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement)) specifying the\n",
    "   maximum time in which all tasks must be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimization**: The challenge lies in finding the _minimum server speed_\n",
    "   that will allow all tasks to be completed within the time stipulated by the\n",
    "   SLA, much like finding the _minimum_ $k$ in our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **real-world issue** with significant implications. Inefficient job\n",
    "scheduling can lead to increased electricity costs, lower throughput, and\n",
    "ultimately, less satisfied clients. Thus, solving this problem efficiently has\n",
    "both **theoretical** and **practical significance** (as mentioned earlier).\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the Koko Eating Bananas problem, you gain insights into how you\n",
    "might approach job scheduling optimization in a data center, a concept that has\n",
    "far-reaching applications in the world of\n",
    "**[cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)** and\n",
    "**[distributed systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "In any computational or mathematical endeavor, **intuition** serves as the\n",
    "_compass_ that guides the journey from problem formulation to solution. While\n",
    "**assumptions** lay the groundwork and **constraints** define the limits,\n",
    "intuition enlightens us on the **_why_** behind a problem. It acts as the mental\n",
    "model that helps us navigate the complexities, making the abstract concrete and\n",
    "the intractable approachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the intuition behind a problem is akin to grasping the motivations\n",
    "behind a storyâ€”it provides _context_, illuminates _significance_, and reveals\n",
    "_underlying patterns_. It shapes our strategic approach, helping us decide which\n",
    "algorithms to employ or what data structures would be most effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, intuition corresponds to the **_why_** that breathes life into the\n",
    "**_how_** and **_what_** of problem-solving. Just as a seasoned chess player\n",
    "instinctively knows which moves lead to victory, a nuanced understanding of\n",
    "problem intuition equips us with the foresight to make **informed decisions**\n",
    "and **optimize solutions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Naive Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The **straightforward method** to solve this problem is to initialize $k = 1$\n",
    "and incrementally test each value of $k$ to see if Koko can finish all the\n",
    "bananas within $h$ hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense because we are interested in finding the **_minimum $k$_** that\n",
    "allows Koko to meet the time constraint. The algorithm proceeds by _iteratively\n",
    "increasing $k$_ and stops at the **first $k$** that allows Koko to consume all\n",
    "the bananas in $h$ or **_fewer_** hours. This \"_first_ $k$\" will be the\n",
    "**minimum $k$** satisfying the given condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **naive approach** has a time complexity of\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(k_{\\text{min}} \\times N)$, where $k_{\\text{min}}$ is the _smallest\n",
    "speed_ at which Koko can consume all the bananas within $h$ hours, and $N$ is\n",
    "the number of piles. Since $k_{\\text{min}}$ is not known in advance and could be\n",
    "large, this approach can be **computationally expensive** for large datasets or\n",
    "**tight time constraints**. Therefore, the **crux of the problem** is to find\n",
    "this _optimal $k$_ without resorting to such a linear search through all\n",
    "potential speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reducing the Search Space\n",
    "\n",
    "The observant reader should notice that actually the $k_{\\text{min}}$ is\n",
    "**_upper bounded_** by the **maximum number of bananas in a pile**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "k_{\\text{min}} \\leq M := \\max(\\text{piles})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we know from the _constraints_ that `piles.length <= h`. This is an\n",
    "important observation because it allows us to **_reduce the search space_** from\n",
    "$[1, \\infty)$ to $[1, M]$. We will always yield a solution if Koko is allowed to\n",
    "eat at a speed of $M$ bananas per hour. She will always be able to finish all\n",
    "the bananas in $h$ hours or fewer. Therefore, we can **_discard all speeds\n",
    "greater than_** $M$. So our time complexity for the naive approach becomes\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(M \\times N)$ since we will at most iterate through $M$ speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show later that we can further optimize this time complexity to\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(M \\log N)$ via a binary search approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we go through some small example(s) to illustrate the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Iterative Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input :\n",
    "   piles = [3,6,7,11],\n",
    "   h     = 8\n",
    "Output:    4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The question at hand is: What is the minimum speed at which Koko can eat all the\n",
    "bananas in the piles within `h` hours?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at each pile individually and calculate the hours it would take for\n",
    "Koko to finish each pile at different speeds:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   At speed 1: Koko would take 3, 6, 7, and 11 hours respectively for each\n",
    "    pile, which sums up to 27 hours in total. This is more than 8 hours, so the\n",
    "    speed is too slow.\n",
    "-   At speed 2: Koko would take 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours respectively for each pile,\n",
    "    which sums up to 15 hours in total. This is still more than 8 hours, so the\n",
    "    speed is still too slow.\n",
    "-   At speed 3: Koko would take 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours respectively for each pile,\n",
    "    which sums up to 10 hours in total. This is still more than 8 hours, so the\n",
    "    speed is still too slow.\n",
    "-   At speed 4: Koko would take 1, 2, 2, and 3 hours respectively for each pile,\n",
    "    which sums up to 8 hours in total. This is exactly the number of hours\n",
    "    available, so the speed is just right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the minimum speed at which Koko can eat all the bananas in the piles\n",
    "within `h = 8` hours is `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Pigeonhole Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input :\n",
    "   piles = [30,11,23,4,20],\n",
    "   h     = 5\n",
    "Output:    30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we are looking for the minimum speed at which Koko can eat all the\n",
    "bananas in the piles within `h` hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that there are only 5 hours available and one of the piles itself has 30\n",
    "bananas, the minimum speed at which Koko must eat to finish just that pile in\n",
    "time is 30 bananas per hour. Since no pile has more than 30 bananas, a speed of\n",
    "30 bananas per hour will also suffice for all other piles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the scenario described, Koko has 5 hours to eat all the bananas from 5 piles,\n",
    "and the largest pile contains 30 bananas. The\n",
    "[**pigeonhole principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle)\n",
    "in this context dictates that each hour must be allocated to a single pile, as\n",
    "there are exactly as many piles as there are hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Koko can only eat from one pile each hour and one of those piles has 30\n",
    "bananas, she must eat at a rate of at least 30 bananas per hour to finish just\n",
    "that pile in time. If her eating speed were any slower, she would not be able to\n",
    "finish the largest pile within the allotted hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, because no pile has more than 30 bananas, a speed of 30 bananas per\n",
    "hour is sufficient for Koko to eat any of the piles within an hour. Therefore,\n",
    "30 bananas per hour is both a necessary and sufficient speed for Koko to eat all\n",
    "the bananas from all the piles within the 5 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between assumptions and constraints in a research or\n",
    "problem-solving context is akin to the interplay between axioms and theorems in\n",
    "a mathematical framework. Assumptions serve as the foundational elements upon\n",
    "which the rest of the work is constructed. They provide the initial conditions\n",
    "or premises that guide the problem-solving approach. On the other hand,\n",
    "constraints are often the derived limitations or boundary conditions that\n",
    "naturally arise from these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:remark} Externally Derived Constraints\n",
    ":label: 875-koko-eating-bananas-externally-derived-constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to understand that constraints can also be externally imposed or\n",
    "arise from specific practical considerations, rather than being directly derived\n",
    "from the problem's assumptions. In such cases, these constraints serve as\n",
    "additional rules or limitations that must be adhered to when seeking a solution.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions set the stage for problem-solving by defining the initial\n",
    "conditions, parameters, or rules that are accepted without direct evidence. They\n",
    "simplify complex situations, making them more manageable and tractable for\n",
    "analysis or computational modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Koko Eating Bananas** problem, we make the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constant Eating Rate**: Koko can only eat a constant number of bananas per\n",
    "   hour (`k`), from a single pile.\n",
    "2. **One Pile at a Time**: Koko will start a new pile only after finishing the\n",
    "   current one.\n",
    "3. **Quantized Eating Periods**: If a pile has fewer bananas than `k`, Koko will\n",
    "   take less than an hour to finish that pile but won't start another pile\n",
    "   within the same hour. This implicitly implies that Koko will not eat any more\n",
    "   bananas from other piles in the same hour even if she finishes eating the\n",
    "   current pile in less than an hour.\n",
    "4. **Existence of Solution**: We assume there exists a solution to the problem.\n",
    "   In other words, we assume that there exists a speed `k` such that Koko can\n",
    "   eat all the bananas in `h` hours or fewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions lead to certain constraints (in no particular order):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Minimum Speed**: Koko can't have a speed of zero; she must eat at least one\n",
    "   banana per hour.\n",
    "2. **Time Constraint**: Koko has only `h` hours, a hard deadline to finish\n",
    "   eating all bananas.\n",
    "3. **Integer Hours**: Time is quantized in hours. Even if Koko takes less than\n",
    "   an hour to finish a pile, she can't start another one within the same hour.\n",
    "4. **Existence of Solution**: The number of piles is less than or equal to the\n",
    "   number of hours. This is because if the number of piles is greater than the\n",
    "   number of hours, then it is impossible for Koko to eat all the bananas in `h`\n",
    "   hours or fewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, leetcode provides the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $1 \\leq \\text{piles.length} \\leq 10^4$\n",
    "-   $\\text{piles.length} \\leq h \\leq 10^9$\n",
    "-   $1 \\leq \\text{piles[i]} \\leq 10^9$\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional constraints from LeetCode serve the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computational Feasibility**: Limiting the array length and the value of `h`\n",
    "   ensures that the problem can be solved within reasonable computational time,\n",
    "   given the algorithmic techniques that candidates are expected to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Problem Scope**: By setting minimum and maximum values, they define the\n",
    "   problem's scope more precisely, thereby allowing for standardized assessment\n",
    "   of solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Edge Cases**: Constraints like $1 \\leq \\text{piles[i]} \\leq 10^9$\n",
    "   help in removing trivial or degenerate cases, focusing the problem on\n",
    "   meaningful scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Algorithmic Complexity**: The constraints provide bounds that can guide the\n",
    "   choice of algorithm, helping one discern whether an $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$\n",
    "   or $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ algorithm is appropriate, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple Piles, Limited Time**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `Input: piles = [30, 11, 23, 4, 20], h = 6`\n",
    "    - `Output: 23`\n",
    "    - **Explanation**: Koko needs a minimum speed of 23 bananas/hour to finish\n",
    "      all bananas in 6 hours or fewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Pile and Minimum Possible Input**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `Input: piles = [1], h = 1`\n",
    "    - `Output: 1`\n",
    "    - **Explanation**: This is the simplest case where the pile has the minimum\n",
    "      number of bananas and Koko has the least amount of time. The speed is also\n",
    "      1 banana/hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Highly Skewed Piles**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `Input: piles = [100, 1, 1, 1], h = 4`\n",
    "    - `Output: 100`\n",
    "    - **Explanation**: The large pile dictates Koko's minimum eating speed. Koko\n",
    "      needs to eat at 100 bananas/hour to finish all bananas in 4 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Large Data Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `Input: piles = [8]*10^6, h = 10^6`\n",
    "    - `Output: 8`\n",
    "    - **Explanation**: This tests the algorithm's ability to handle\n",
    "      **large-scale scenarios** efficiently. Koko would need to eat at least 8\n",
    "      bananas/hour.\n",

    "approach to solve this problem is using binary search on $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary search would operate on the speed range $[1, M]$, and for each\n",
    "candidate speed, we need to traverse all the piles to check if Koko can finish\n",

    "number of bananas in a pile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Best Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "For the binary search algorithm, we only need a constant amount of extra space\n",
    "to store variables such as the low, high, and mid points of the search, as well\n",
    "as a counter for the total hours Koko would take for a given $k$. Therefore, the\n",

    "\n",
    "### Space-Time Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific problem, there's limited scope for a space-time tradeoff. The\n",
    "time complexity is primarily determined by the need to iterate over all the\n",
    "piles for each candidate $k$, and this is not something that can be pre-computed\n",
    "or stored to save time later. Similarly, the space complexity is already at its\n",

    "what constitutes this intuition, and how can it be developed? In general, if a\n",

    "\n",
    "#### The Precondition for Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "The main precondition for applying binary search to this problem is the property\n",
    "of **monotonicity** in the **feasibility**\n",
    "function[^precondition-of-binary-search]. If a **feasibility** function\n",
    "$\\mathcal{F}(\\cdot)$ is **monotonic**, then the problem lends itself well to a\n",
    "binary search solution. Here, the feasible function $\\mathcal{F}(\\cdot)$ is a\n",
    "boolean function that returns either `True` or `False`, or `1` or `0` since we\n",
    "want to talk about monotonicity, which is better understood if the output is a\n",
    "\"number\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The second precondition is implicit. The search space $\\mathcal{K}$ must be\n",
    "inherently **ordered** in which you can sort it (sortable). This is because\n",
    "binary search requires the search space to be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the domain of the feasibility function $\\mathcal{F}(\\cdot)$ is the\n",
    "search space $\\mathcal{K}$, and the range is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why is having this monotonicity property important? Why is it that we need\n",
    "this feasibility function to be monotonic? The reason is that we want to be able\n",
    "to discard half of the search space at each step. This is the key to binary\n",
    "search. The connection is that monotonicity implies there is a tipping point.\n",
    "There exists a $k$ such that if $\\mathcal{F}(k) = 1$, then $\\mathcal{F}(k') = 1$\n",
    "for all $k' > k$.\n",

    "    Koko can only eat from one pile at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem lends itself to a binary search approach due to its inherent\n",
    "monotonicity. To illustrate, consider an example with `piles = [3, 6, 7, 11]`\n",

    "We then evaluate whether Koko can consume all the bananas within $h = 8$ hours\n",
    "at a speed of $k = 6$ bananas per hour. The answer is affirmative, requiring\n",
    "`[1, 1, 2, 2]` hours for the respective piles. Consequently, all speeds\n",
    "$k' > k = 6$ must also satisfy this condition. This enables us to discard the\n",

    "\n",
    "Conversely, if we arrive at an insufficient speed, say $k = 3$, then all speeds\n",

    "The monotonic property guarantees that if a speed $k$ enables Koko to consume\n",

    "#### Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "Proving the correctness of a binary search algorithm typically involves\n",
    "demonstrating two properties: invariance and termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:proof}\n",
    "We prove both properties here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invariant**: At each iteration of the binary search, we maintain the invariant\n",
    "that the optimal eating speed $k^*$ must lie within the interval $[l, r]$. This\n",
    "is because we only adjust $l$ or $r$ based on the feasibility function, which\n",
    "correctly tells us whether a certain speed is too slow (and thus, the optimal\n",
    "speed must be higher) or feasible (and thus, the optimal speed could be lower or\n",
    "equal).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: At the start, $l = 1$ and $r = M$. Clearly, $k^*$ must\n",
    "   lie within this range because it's defined to be a positive integer that's no\n",
    "   greater than $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintenance**: At each step, we calculate\n",
    "   $m = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{l + r}{2} \\right\\rfloor$. Then, based on\n",
    "   $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathcal{P}, m, h)$, we either set $r = m$ or $l = m + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathcal{P}, m, h) = 1$, meaning that eating speed $m$ is\n",
    "     feasible, we set $r = m$. This is correct because if $m$ is feasible, then\n",
    "     any speed greater than $m$ might also be feasible, but the optimal speed\n",
    "     (the smallest feasible speed) must be less than or equal to $m$. Hence, we\n",
    "     adjust the interval to $[l, m]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathcal{P}, m, h) = 0$, meaning that eating speed $m$ is\n",
    "     not feasible, we set $l = m + 1$. This is correct because if $m$ is not\n",
    "     feasible, then any speed less than $m$ is also not feasible. Hence, the\n",
    "     optimal speed must be greater than $m$, and we adjust the interval to\n",
    "     $[m + 1, r]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By updating $l$ and $r$ in this manner, we ensure that the interval $[l, r]$\n",
    "always contains $k^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Termination**: The algorithm terminates when $l \\geq r$. Due to the properties\n",
    "of the floor function and the update rules for $l$ and $r$, this condition will\n",
    "eventually be met. At this point, the interval has been narrowed down to a\n",
    "single point, $l$, which must be the optimal eating speed $k^*$. This follows\n",
    "from the invariant; since $k^*$ was always within the interval, and the interval\n",
    "has been reduced to a single point, that point must be $k^*$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes the proof of correctness for the binary search algorithm in the\n",
    "context of the Koko eating bananas problem. The invariance ensures that the\n",
    "optimal solution is never excluded from the search space, and the termination\n",
    "condition guarantees that the algorithm will converge to the optimal solution.\n",

    ":header-rows: 1\n",

    "\n",
    "For the Koko eating bananas problem, however, each iteration of the binary\n",

    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity can be broken down into two components: input space\n",
    "complexity and auxiliary space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The input for the Koko eating bananas problem is the list of banana piles. This\n",
    "input occupies $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ space, where $N$ is the number of piles. The\n",
    "speed $k$ and the hours $h$ are just integers, so they occupy constant space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Auxiliary Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Auxiliary space refers to the extra space used by an algorithm, not including\n",
    "the space taken up by the inputs. For the Koko problem, if we are implementing\n",
    "the binary search iteratively, the auxiliary space complexity would be constant,\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(1)$, because we only need a fixed number of variables: one for the\n",
    "low end of our search space (`l`), one for the high end (`r`), and occasionally\n",
    "one for the midpoint (`m`) during each iteration of the binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm does not use any dynamic data structures, like lists or arrays,\n",
    "that grow with the input size, and there is no recursive stack space to consider\n",
    "since it's an iterative approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Total space complexity is the sum of input and auxiliary space complexities.\n",
    "Since the input space complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ and the auxiliary space\n",
    "complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, the total space complexity for the Koko eating\n",
    "bananas problem is $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ when considering the input space. If we\n",
    "choose not to consider the input space, the space complexity remains\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the algorithm for solving the Koko eating bananas problem is\n",
    "space-efficient, requiring only constant auxiliary space. The total space\n",
    "complexity is primarily determined by the input size.\n",
