    "    tables in a fast and efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have a sorted list of numbers, denoted $\\mathcal{A}$, of size $N$ and\n",
    "we want to find a particular number in the list, called the target $\\tau$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we know from **[Linear Search](../linear_search/concept.md)** that we\n",
    "still have to traverse each element until we find the target $\\tau$, or reach\n",
    "the end of the list. This yields a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, with $N$\n",
    "being the size of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the list is **sorted**, we can leverage a strategy known as\n",
    "**[divide and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm)**\n",
    "to improve our search speed significantly. This is where\n",
    "**[Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)** comes\n",
    "into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle behind binary search is that we continually **halve** our search\n",
    "space, which we denote as $\\mathcal{S}$ (to be conceptualized later). We begin\n",
    "with the whole list, then determine whether our target value is in the first or\n",
    "the second half by comparing it with the middle element. If our target is less\n",
    "than the middle element, it must lie in the first half of the list, so we can\n",
    "immediately discard the second half. Conversely, if our target is larger than\n",
    "the middle element, it must reside in the second half, and we discard the first\n",
    "half.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues until we either find our target or our search space\n",
    "$\\mathcal{S}$ is exhausted, i.e., there's no element left to check. Each\n",
    "iteration effectively **halves** the problem size, resulting in a logarithmic\n",
    "time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$. This makes binary search markedly more\n",
    "efficient than linear search, particularly in large, sorted datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neat connection exists between binary search and the concept of a\n",
    "**[Binary Search Tree (BST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)**.\n",
    "In a BST, each node has a value larger than all the values in its left subtree\n",
    "and smaller than all the values in its right subtree. This is akin to how binary\n",
    "search operates, dividing the list into two halves, with one half always less\n",
    "than and the other always greater than the middle. Indeed, if you perform an\n",
    "inorder traversal of a BST (left, root, right), you retrieve the elements in\n",
    "sorted order, just as you would have them arranged for a binary search. So the\n",
    "middle number of the sorted list is the \"root\" of the BST, and the left and\n",
    "right halves of the list are the left and right subtrees of the root. This is a\n",
    "great way to visualize the process of binary search and how it operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we conceptualize the intuition via examples and visualizations,\n",
    "and lastly through defining the algorithm rigorously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following sorted list of numbers $\\mathcal{A}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{A} = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\n",

    "and we seek to find if the number $23$ exists in the list.\n",

    "    - $r = N - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9$\n",

    "## Assumptions and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorted Array**: We assume the input array is already sorted in ascending\n",
    "   order, as binary search is not suitable for unsorted arrays.\n",
    "2. **Unique Elements**: As mentioned, the array consists of unique elements.\n",
    "   This implies that the return index for any valid target is unique.\n",
    "3. **Deterministic**: The input array does not change during the course of the\n",
    "   algorithm, and there are no external factors affecting its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The constaints/assumptions are made below, we follow the same set of assumptions\n",
    "from [LeetCode's Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)\n",
    "with some modifications (for clarity):\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The array must be sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "-   The array consists of **unique** elements of type `int` with base 10.\n",
    "-   **Array Length**: The length of the array `nums` will always be in the range\n",
    "    `1 <= len(nums) <= 10^4`.\n",
    "-   **Array Content**: Every element in the array, as well as the target value,\n",
    "    is guaranteed to be in the range `-10^4 <= nums[i], target <= 10^4`.\n",
    "-   **Return Value**: The function should return the index of the `target` if it\n",
    "    exists in `nums` and `-1` if it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Left + Right // 2 May Cause Overflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the constraints listed is that the array values are guaranteed to be in\n",
    "the range `-10^4 <= nums[i], target <= 10^4`. This means that the maximum value\n",
    "of the array elements is $10^4$. Why does it matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, when two integers are added, and the result goes beyond the\n",
    "maximum value that can be stored in that integer type, it's referred to as an\n",
    "integer overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a 32-bit signed integer in most languages. The largest value it can\n",
    "hold is $2^{31} - 1$, because one bit is reserved for the sign. When you add two\n",
    "large numbers, their sum might exceed this value, causing an overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore the mid calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\ell + r}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\ell$ and $r$ are very large (close to the maximum value for the integer\n",
    "type), their sum can overflow, even though their average (mid value) might still\n",
    "be within the valid range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's take a hypothetical situation where the maximum value an integer\n",
    "can store is $15$ (in reality, this is much larger, but we're simplifying for\n",
    "the sake of illustration).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $\\ell = 7$ and $r = 14$. When you add these together, you get\n",
    "$\\ell + r = 21$, which exceeds our hypothetical maximum value of $15$. Hence, an\n",
    "overflow occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we use the safer approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = l + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{r - l}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With our values, we'd get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = 7 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{14 - 7}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 7 + 3 = 10$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach avoids overflow because $\\ell$ and\n",
    "$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{r - l}{2} \\right\\rfloor$ will always be valid integers and\n",
    "their sum will be too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world applications, this is relevant for very large arrays when using\n",
    "32-bit integers. Using 64-bit integers (like `long long` in C++ or `int64` in\n",
    "some other languages) delays the point where overflow might occur, but the\n",
    "principle remains. The alternate method for calculating mid is a safer approach\n",
    "that avoids the potential overflow issue altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for clarity, we will interchangeably use the original mid calculation\n",
    "in our explanation(s) below.\n",

    "\n",
    "We break down the space complexity of binary search into three parts: input,\n",
    "auxiliary and total space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Input space complexity is the space used to store the input to the problem. For\n",
    "a binary search, the input is the array or list we are searching through, and a\n",
    "target value. We do not usually consider the space taken by the inputs when\n",
    "analyzing the space complexity of an algorithm, unless the algorithm modifies\n",
    "the input in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, for the sake of completeness, we say that the input space is the\n",
    "space taken by the inputs, which is parameterized by the length of the array\n",
    "$\\mathcal{A}$ and the target value $\\tau$. In this case, the input space\n",
    "complexity is\n",

    "\\mathcal{O}(N) + \\mathcal{O}(1) = \\mathcal{O}(N),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the length of the array and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is the space taken by\n",
    "the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Auxiliary Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Auxiliary space complexity is the extra space or the temporary space used by an\n",
    "algorithm. In the case of binary search, we only need three variables to hold\n",
    "the left, right and middle indices (`l`, `r`, `m`). These variables occupy\n",
    "constant space, so the auxiliary space complexity is in the order of\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the iterative approach, only one stack frame is used, contributing to the\n",
    "auxiliary space complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. There is no extra allocation in\n",
    "each iteration of the while loop in terms of variables or object instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Total space complexity is the sum of input and auxiliary space complexities. For\n",
    "binary search, if the input space complexity is not considered and the auxiliary\n",
    "space complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, the total space complexity of binary\n",
    "search is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, else it is $\\mathcal{O}(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the binary search algorithm is very space-efficient as it only\n",
    "requires constant auxiliary space to perform the search, and it does not modify\n",
    "the input array or list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm (Recursive + Exact Match)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also implement binary search recursively. The recursive version of binary\n",

    "      return value `m` is immediately passed back up to the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Preventing Overwriting**: Since each recursive call has its own execution\n",
    "   context (its own local variables, parameters, etc.), the returned value does\n",
    "   not get overwritten by other operations within those recursive calls. The\n",
    "   value `m` simply bubbles up through the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Return**: Eventually, the value reaches the initial call, and that's\n",
    "   the value finally returned by the recursive function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism ensures that once the target is found and a value is returned, it\n",

    "-   $b$ is the factor by which the subproblem size is reduced in each recursive\n",
    "    call ($b > 1$).\n",
    "-   $\\frac{N}{b}$ is the size of each subproblem. (All subproblems are assumed\n",
    "    to have the same size.)\n",

    "1. If $f(N) = \\mathcal{O}(N^c)$, where $c < c_{\\text{crit}}$, then\n",
    "   $\\mathcal{T}(N) = \\Theta(N^{c_{\\text{crit}}})$.\n",

    "#### Repeated Substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the time complexity of our function as $\\mathcal{T}(N)$, where $N$\n",
    "is the number of elements being considered during a given recursive call.\n",
    "Initially, $N$ is the size of the entire list, but with each recursive call, it\n",
    "gets halved.\n",
    "\n",
    "On every recursive call to the `recursive` function, the list is divided into\n",
    "two halves, and only one half is considered for further search. Hence, the size\n",
    "of the problem is reduced to half its previous size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the recurrence relation, let's break down the operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We calculate the middle index, which takes constant time $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n",
    "2. We make a decision based on the middle element, again taking $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\n",
    "   time.\n",
    "3. We make a recursive call, but only on half of the current list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting this into a recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{T}(N) = \\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a standard divide-and-conquer recurrence relation. We can solve it using\n",
    "the Master Theorem or repeated substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using repeated substitution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathcal{T}(N) &= \\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(1) \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{T}(N) &= \\left[\\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{N}{4}\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(1)\\right] + \\mathcal{O}(1) \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{T}(N) &= \\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{N}{4}\\right) + 2\\mathcal{O}(1) \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{T}(N) &= \\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{N}{8}\\right) + 3\\mathcal{O}(1) \\\\\n",
    "&\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{T}(N) &= \\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{N}{2^k}\\right) + k\\mathcal{O}(1)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, $\\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{N}{2^k}\\right)$ will be $\\mathcal{T}(1)$ (i.e., a\n",
    "constant) when $\\frac{N}{2^k} = 1$ or $k = \\log N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the expansion becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{T}(N) = \\mathcal{T}(1) + \\log N \\cdot \\mathcal{O}(1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that $\\mathcal{T}(1)$ is a constant time, the dominating factor here is\n",
    "$\\log N$. Therefore, the time complexity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{T}(N) = \\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "For recursive algorithms, the space complexity is often determined by the\n",
    "maximum depth of the recursion. In other words, it's based on the maximum number\n",
    "of recursive calls that are in progress at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the intuition is simple, we already established there can be a maximum of\n",
    "$\\log N$ splits, thus it follows that the recursion depth is bounded by\n",
    "$\\log N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of a recursive binary search gets divided into three parts:\n",
    "input, auxiliary, and total space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Input space complexity is the space used to store the input to the problem. For\n",
    "binary search, the input is the array or list we are searching through, and a\n",
    "target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, we don't consider the space taken by the inputs when analyzing\n",
    "the space complexity of an algorithm, unless the algorithm modifies the input in\n",
    "place. But if we do want to consider the input space, that's the space taken by\n",
    "the inputs, which is $\\mathcal{O}(N) + \\mathcal{O}(1) = \\mathcal{O}(N)$, where\n",
    "$N$ is the length of the array, and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is the space taken by the\n",
    "target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Auxiliary Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Auxiliary space complexity is the extra space or temporary space used by an\n",
    "algorithm. In the case of recursive binary search, we still only need three\n",
    "variables to hold the left, right, and middle indices (`l`, `r`, `m`). These\n",
    "variables occupy constant space, so the auxiliary space complexity is\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(1)$ per recursive call.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because this is a recursive function, we also have to consider the\n",
    "space taken up by the recursion stack. In the worst-case scenario, binary search\n",
    "makes $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ recursive calls, and each call adds a level to the\n",
    "stack. So, the auxiliary space complexity in this case is $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that an iterative implementation of binary search would have a space\n",
    "complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, as it doesn't need additional space that grows\n",
    "with the input size. It only uses a constant amount of space to store the\n",
    "pointers and the target element.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the recursive binary search:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Each time we make a recursive call, we essentially halve the input size.\n",
    "-   At most, we would need to make $\\log N$ recursive calls (since we are\n",
    "    dividing by 2 each time) before we either find our target or exhaust the\n",
    "    list.\n",
    "-   Each of these calls gets pushed onto the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the maximum height of the call stack, and hence the space complexity\n",
    "due to the recursive calls, is $O(\\log N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Total space complexity is the sum of input and auxiliary space complexities. For\n",
    "binary search, if the input space complexity is not considered and the uses\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ auxiliary space, the total space complexity of recursive\n",
    "binary search is $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$; otherwise, it is $\\mathcal{O}(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the recursive binary search algorithm is still very\n",
    "space-efficient as it only requires logarithmic auxiliary space to perform the\n",
    "search, and it does not modify the input array or list.\n",
