    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The\n",
    "implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue, which are:\n",
    "`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `MyQueue` should include the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `push(int x)`: Pushes element `x` to the back of the queue.\n",
    "-   `pop()`: Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.\n",
    "-   `peek()`: Returns the element at the front of the queue.\n",
    "-   `empty()`: Returns `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main challenge here is that stacks are Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structures,\n",
    "but we need to implement a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure using them. We\n",
    "can solve this problem by using two stacks, where one stack serves as a\n",
    "reversing mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we push elements into the queue, we push them into the first stack. To pop\n",
    "an element, we need to get it from the bottom of the first stack. However,\n",
    "because we can only remove elements from the top in a stack, we transfer all\n",
    "elements from the first stack to the second stack, which reverses the order of\n",
    "the elements. Then, we can simply pop the top element from the second stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy way out which also works is just use one stack and use `insert` to push\n",
    "elements to the bottom of the stack. However, this is not a good solution\n",
    "because `insert` is an expensive operation. It takes $O(n)$ time to insert an\n",
    "element to the bottom of a stack of size $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You must only utilize the standard operations of a stack: pushing to the\n",
    "    top, peeking/popping from the top, checking its size, and checking if it's\n",
    "    empty.\n",
    "-   Depending on your programming language, stacks might not be supported\n",
    "    natively. However, you can simulate a stack using a list or a deque\n",
    "    (double-ended queue) as long as you stick to the stack's standard\n",
    "    operations.\n",
    "-   In our examples, we'll be using Python's `list` to represent a stack. We\n",
    "    will be using two stacks:\n",
    "    -   The `enqueue` stack: This stack is used for the `push` operation. In\n",
    "        this stack, an element that is pushed first will be on the bottom and\n",
    "        the element pushed last will be on the top. For instance, if we push 1,\n",
    "        2, 3, and 4 in this order, our `enqueue` stack will look like\n",
    "        `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Here, `1` is at the front of the queue (the bottom of\n",
    "        the stack) and `4` is at the back of the queue (the top of the stack).\n",
    "    -   The `dequeue` stack: This stack is used for the `pop` and `peek`\n",
    "        operations. The order of the elements in this stack is the reverse of\n",
    "        their order in the `enqueue` stack. If our `enqueue` stack is\n",
    "        `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, our `dequeue` stack will be `[4, 3, 2, 1]`. In this\n",
    "        case, `1` is still at the front of the queue (now the top of the stack)\n",
    "        and `4` is at the back of the queue (now the bottom of the stack).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The value that can be pushed into the queue (`x`) is constrained by the\n",
    "    range:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    1 \\leq x \\leq 9.\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The total number of function calls made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and\n",
    "    `empty` will not exceed 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   All calls to `pop` and `peek` functions will be valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Constraints for?\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming problems, **constraints** are set to define the scope and limits\n",
    "of the problem. They help us determine the feasible approaches and solutions for\n",
    "the problem by providing information about the range and characteristics of the\n",
    "input data. They also allow us to anticipate the worst-case scenarios that our\n",
    "algorithm should be able to handle without leading to inefficiencies or\n",
    "failures, such as exceeding the time limit or the memory limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the current problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The constraint on `x` (i.e., $1 \\leq x \\leq 9$) specifies the minimum and\n",
    "    maximum value that can be pushed into the queue. Knowing this, we can\n",
    "    evaluate whether our solution would handle all possible values of `x`. This\n",
    "    constraint is important to consider when dealing with edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The constraint on the number of function calls (i.e., at most 100 calls will\n",
    "    be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`) informs us about the maximum\n",
    "    operations our solution should handle efficiently. A solution with a time\n",
    "    complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, where $n$ is the number of operations, would\n",
    "    likely be acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The stipulation that all calls to `pop` and `peek` functions will be valid\n",
    "    simplifies the problem by indicating that we do not need to consider\n",
    "    scenarios where these functions are called on an empty queue. This\n",
    "    eliminates the need for additional error checking in our implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Test Case 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Operations: `push(5)`, `push(6)`, `push(7)`, `pop()`, `push(8)`,\n",

    "        `None`, `False`\n",
    "    -   Explanation: After each push and pop operation, the queue state is\n",
    "        updated. The peek operation does not change the queue state. The empty\n",
    "        operation returns `False` since the queue is not empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Test Case 2:\n",
    "    -   Operations: `push(2)`, `push(4)`, `pop()`, `push(6)`, `pop()`, `pop()`,\n",

    "    -   Explanation: After each push and pop operation, the queue state is\n",
    "        updated. The empty operation returns `True` as the queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Solution (Using Two Stacks)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **queue** operates on the principle of\n",
    "[**First In First Out (FIFO)**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)>),\n",
    "meaning that the elements that are inserted first are the ones that get removed\n",
    "first. Commonly, queues are implemented using\n",
    "[**linked lists**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), with new elements\n",
    "being added to the rear and removed from the front. However, in this instance,\n",
    "we are implementing a queue using two **stacks**, which inherently operate on a\n",
    "[**Last In First Out (LIFO)**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)>)\n",
    "basis. Here, elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "To emulate the FIFO behavior of a queue using stacks, we need two of them. These\n",
    "two stacks collaboratively work to reverse the order of element arrival,\n",
    "effectively transforming the LIFO behavior of a stack into the FIFO behavior of\n",
    "a queue. Consequently, one of the stacks ends up holding the queue elements in\n",
    "the order they should logically be in if we were using a traditional queue\n",
    "structure. This innovative use of two stacks provides an alternative approach to\n",
    "implementing a queue data structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, this would be overly pessimistic as the bound given by the worst case\n",
