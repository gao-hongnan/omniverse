    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the fundamental concept of a **Stack** as an abstract data type in\n",
    "   computer science, characterized by its **_Last In, First Out (LIFO)_**\n",
    "   principle.\n",
    "2. Grasp the intuition behind a stack as a collection with restricted access,\n",
    "   analogous to real-world examples such as a stack of books or a **_stack of\n",
    "   plates_** in a restaurant.\n",
    "3. Learn the core operations of a stack, including `push`, `pop`, `peek`,\n",
    "   `is_empty`, and `size`, along with their descriptions and significance.\n",
    "4. Comprehend the implementation details of the `StackList` class in Python,\n",
    "   particularly focusing on its usage of a dynamic array (Python list) for stack\n",
    "   operations and its implementation as a **Generic** class for type\n",
    "   flexibility.\n",
    "5. Be able to implement and use the `StackList` class, including pushing items\n",
    "   onto the stack, checking its size, peeking at the top item, popping items\n",
    "   off, and iterating over the stack.\n",
    "6. Understand the **time complexity** of the stack operations, particularly the\n",
    "   average and amortized worst-case time complexities, along with an explanation\n",
    "   of **amortized analysis** and **exponential growth strategy**.\n",
    "7. Recognize the **space complexity** of the `StackList` class and how it varies\n",
    "   based on the types and sizes of the elements stored in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**Stack**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)>) data\n",
    "structure is a fundamental concept in computer science, acting as an abstract\n",
    "model for storing and managing data in a specific order. This\n",
    "[**_Last In, First Out (LIFO)_**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lifo-last-in-first-out-approach-in-programming/)\n",
    "principle underpins its functionality, where the last element added to the stack\n",
    "is the first one to be removed. Understanding stacks is crucial for various\n",
    "computing tasks, from algorithm design to system operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, a stack represents a collection with restricted access, akin to a\n",
    "real-world stack of items. The primary intuition behind a stack is its\n",
    "sequential access pattern - you can only add or remove items from the top. This\n",
    "structure is analogous to a stack of books; you can only remove the top book\n",
    "without disturbing the others. In computer science, stacks are used to store\n",
    "data in a way that provides fast access to the last item added, but does not\n",
    "allow for random access to other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogy: The Stack of Plates\n",
    "\n",
    "An excellent analogy for understanding stacks is the **_stack of plates_** in a\n",
    "restaurant, particularly in a sushi restaurant. Imagine this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The **plate loader** in a sushi restaurant, where plates are neatly stacked\n",
    "    one over the other, serves as a vivid illustration of a stack.\n",
    "-   When you finish eating from a plate, you place it on top of the stack on the\n",
    "    **plate loader**. This action is akin to the `push` operation in a stack,\n",
    "    where an element is added to the top.\n",
    "-   Now, consider the stack transitioning into a coding environment. We initiate\n",
    "    an empty stack `s` represented as `s = []`. In this representation, **_the\n",
    "    end of the list is treated as the top of the stack_**.\n",
    "-   As you add more plates (e.g., `p1`, `p2`), you `push` them onto the stack:\n",
    "    `s.push(p1)`, leading to `s = [p1]`, and then `s.push(p2)`, resulting in\n",
    "    `s = [p1, p2]`.\n",
    "-   When a waiter clears the topmost plate, this is similar to the `pop`\n",
    "    operation, which **_returns and removes_** the top item of the stack. Thus,\n",
    "    executing `s.pop()` would return `p2`, modifying the stack to `s = [p1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have went through the two fundamental operations (amongst others) on\n",
    "stack: `push` and `pop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `push` operation pushes something on the top of the stack (appending to a\n",
    "    list);\n",
    "-   `pop` operation returns and removes the top most item from the stack\n",
    "    (popping from the list).\n",

    "### Real-World Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, stacks are ubiquitous in scenarios requiring reverse order\n",
    "processing. For instance, in web browsers, the **Back** button functionality is\n",
    "a classic example. Each visited webpage is \"pushed\" onto a stack, and clicking\n",
    "**Back** \"pops\" the pages in reverse visitation order, demonstrating stack’s\n",
    "utility in history navigation[^stack-applications].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stack with List as Underlying Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a\n",
    "collection of elements with two principal operations: push, which adds an\n",
    "element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added\n",
    "element. In many programming languages, the built-in list or array structures\n",
    "are used to implement the stack due to their efficiency and simplicity. In\n",
    "Python, the `list` is particularly well-suited for this purpose because it\n",
    "provides built-in methods for stack operations, such as `append()` for push and\n",
    "`pop()` for pop operations, which both run in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ average time\n",
    "complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use a List for Stack Implementation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python lists are dynamic arrays behind the scenes. This makes them ideal for\n",
    "implementing stacks because:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   They provide **amortized constant time complexity** ($\\mathcal{O}(1)$) for\n",
    "    adding and removing items from the end[^list-pop-time-complexity].\n",
    "-   Lists are **dynamic**, so they can grow and shrink on demand, which suits\n",
    "    the variable size nature of stacks.\n",
    "-   They come with built-in methods that directly correspond to stack operations\n",
    "    (`append` for push and `pop` without an index for pop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Python lists sidesteps the need for managing the capacity of the\n",
    "underlying data structure, which is an advantage over using a fixed-size array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before implementing the stack, let's define the operations that will be\n",
    "supported by the `StackList` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{list-table} Stack List Operations\n",
    ":header-rows: 1\n",
    ":name: stack-list-operations\n",
    "\n",
    "* - Operation\n",
    "  - Description\n",
    "* - `push`\n",
    "  - Appends an item to the end of the `_stack_items` list, effectively pushing\n",
    "    it onto the stack.\n",
    "* - `pop`\n",
    "  - Removes and returns the last item from `_stack_items`, adhering to the Last\n",
    "    In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Raises an exception if the stack is empty.\n",
    "* - `peek`\n",
    "  - Returns the last item without removing it, providing a view of the top item\n",
    "    of the stack. Raises an exception if the stack is empty.\n",
    "* - `is_empty`\n",
    "  - Returns `True` if the stack is empty, otherwise `False`.\n",
    "* - `size`\n",
    "  - A property that returns the number of items in the stack, utilizing the\n",
    "    `__len__` method to return the length of `_stack_items`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our class inherits `Generic[T]` to make it a generic class, meaning it can store\n",
    "items of any type. This flexibility is provided by the use of the generic type\n",
    "variable `T` in `TypeVar(\"T\")`. Furthermore, since `StackList` is a container,\n",
    "inheritance from `Generic[T]` is necessary to ensure type safety and clarity.\n",
    "For example, we can instantiate a `StackList` of integers by specifying the type\n",
    "`StackList[int]`, and the type hints will be enforced by the class (by a static\n",
    "type checker such as `mypy`) so that that particular stack instance can only\n",
    "store integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack being a container, we will also implement some dunder methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{list-table} Stack List Dunder Methods\n",
    ":header-rows: 1\n",
    ":name: stack-list-dunder-methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* - Dunder Method\n",
    "  - Description\n",
    "* - `__len__`\n",
    "  - Returns the length of the stack, which is the length of `_stack_items`.\n",
    "* - `__iter__`\n",
    "  - Returns an iterator over the stack, which is implemented using a generator\n",
    "    that yields items from the stack using `self.pop()`. This means each\n",
    "    iteration over the `StackList` instance will modify the stack by removing\n",
    "    its elements.\n",

    "3. **Peeking**: The `peek` method is used to view the top item of the stack\n",
    "   without removing it. In this case, it should be `6`.\n",
    "4. **Popping**: The `pop` method is used to remove and return the top item of\n",

    "    time—the allocation strategy of Python lists employs an exponential growth\n",

    "    [Python Time Complexity page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity),\n",
    "    which lists both the average and amortized worst-case complexities for\n",
    "    `list.append` as $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n",

    "    `list[-1]`), is an operation with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n",

    "1. **Amortized Analysis**: In amortized analysis, we average the time complexity\n",
    "   over a sequence of operations, not just a single operation. For Python lists,\n",
    "   when a resizing occurs (which is an $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ operation), it doesn't\n",

    "   happen exponentially less often as the size of the list grows. This strategy\n",
    "   ensures that, averaged over a large number of appends, the time per operation\n",
    "   is still constant, or $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exponential Growth Strategy**: When a Python list needs to resize, it\n",
    "   doesn't just increase its size by one element. Instead, it typically\n",
    "   increases its size by a larger amount (approximately doubling, although the\n",

    "   operation of resizing and copying the list is $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, such\n",
    "   operations happen so infrequently that their cost is \"amortized\" over the\n",
    "   many $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ append operations, resulting in an overall\n",
    "   $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ amortized time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Worst-Case vs. Amortized Worst-Case**: The worst-case scenario for a single\n",
    "   operation of `list.append()` can indeed be $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ (when a resize\n",

    "the sizes of these containers. In the case where each element has a similar size\n",
    "`M`, the space complexity can be approximated as $\\mathcal{O}(N \\times M)$. For\n",
    "variable-sized containers, the complexity becomes the sum of the sizes of all\n",
