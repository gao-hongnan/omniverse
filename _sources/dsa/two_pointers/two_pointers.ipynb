    "The **Two Pointers Technique** is a method where two pointers are used to\n",
    "traverse an array from two different points. Typically, this method is employed\n",
    "in a sorted array or list where the goal is to solve problems that demand the\n",
    "use of less time complexity, which is a primary factor in optimizing algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two pointers technique is very useful in solving problems with linear data\n",
    "structures like arrays and linked lists. It's most often used when we need to\n",
    "find a pair of elements in the array that meet certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of the two pointers technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: You initialize two pointers, a left pointer (usually\n",
    "   denoted as `left` or `start`) that starts from the beginning of the array,\n",
    "   and a right pointer (usually denoted as `right` or `end`) that starts from\n",
    "   the end of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Traversal**: Depending upon the condition, both pointers start moving\n",
    "   towards each other. This movement can either be step-by-step or in a\n",
    "   skip-over fashion (like in binary search).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Meeting Point**: The process continues until the two pointers meet, which\n",
    "   will be the case if the array is traversed completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two pointers technique can be classified into two types based on the\n",
    "direction of the two pointers:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Same Direction Two Pointers**: In this, both pointers traverse in the same\n",
    "    direction. An example is the Sliding Window algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Opposite Direction Two Pointers**: Here, pointers traverse in the opposite\n",
    "    direction. A typical example is to find the target sum in a sorted array or\n",
    "    to sort a binary array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of the two pointers technique in computer science are numerous:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Array and List Problems**: The technique is used to solve various array\n",
    "    and list problems efficiently, such as finding a pair with a given sum,\n",
    "    removing duplicates from a sorted list, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **String Manipulation**: The two pointers technique is frequently used in\n",
    "    string manipulation problems, like checking if a string is a palindrome or\n",
    "    not.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Linked List Problems**: The technique can be used to solve problems like\n",
    "    finding the middle element of a linked list, detecting a cycle in a linked\n",
    "    list, finding the kth element from the end in a single pass, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its apparent simplicity, the two pointers technique underpins many\n",
    "algorithmic problems and solutions. Mastering how it works is crucial to\n",
    "understanding, designing, and implementing effective algorithms and data\n",
    "structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the two pointers technique, LeetCode has a\n",
    "[Two Pointers category](https://leetcode.com/tag/two-pointers/) dedicated to\n",
    "problems that can be solved using this technique. The problems range in\n",
    "difficulty levels, allowing learners to gradually master this technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Two Pointers Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "The two pointers technique is a common algorithmic strategy that utilizes two\n",
    "pointers that traverse through an array in a synchronized manner, often with the\n",
    "objective of finding a pair of elements satisfying a particular condition or\n",
    "reducing the time complexity of an otherwise expensive operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Pointers Same Direction\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a sequence $S$ defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_n]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "of $n$ elements where $s_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. We have\n",
    "two pointers $i$ and $j$, such that $1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ and $i \\leq j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task often involves finding a pair of elements $s_i$ and $s_j$ that satisfy\n",
    "a particular condition $C(s_i, s_j)$. The pointers are moved according to the\n",
    "evaluation of condition $C$ and the specific problem requirements. The general\n",
    "algorithm can be described as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "Input: Sequence $S$ of $n$ elements, Condition $C$\n",

    "2.  While $i \\leq n$ and $j \\leq n$ do:\n",
    "    - If $C(s_i, s_j)$ is True:\n",
    "        1. Process valid pair $(s_i, s_j)$\n",
    "        2. Increment $i$ by $1$\n",
    "    - Else, increment $j$ by $1$\n",
    "3.  End while\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this algorithm, we start with both pointers at the beginning of the sequence.\n",
    "We evaluate condition $C(s_i, s_j)$. If it's satisfied, we process the pair and\n",
    "move the left pointer forward. If it's not, we move the right pointer forward.\n",
    "This continues until we've traversed the whole sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is particularly useful when the sequence is sorted, and condition\n",

    "### Removing Duplicates from a Sorted Array\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the \"Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array\" problem, the\n",
    "sequence $S$ can be defined as $S = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_n]$, where $s_i$ denotes\n",
    "the $i$-th element in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, we start with two pointers, $i$ and $j$, at the beginning of\n",

    "-   The \"slow\" pointer $i$ marks the position where the next unique element\n",
    "    should be placed.\n",
    "-   The \"fast\" pointer $j$ scans through the array to find the next unique\n",
    "    element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition $C(s_i, s_j)$ that guides the movement of the pointers in this\n",

    "\n",
    "-   If $C(s_i, s_j)$ is True (i.e., $s_i \\neq s_j$), we have found a\n",

    "    element at the $i$-th position with the value of $s_j$, i.e., $s_i = s_j$.\n",
    "-   If $C(s_i, s_j)$ is False (i.e., $s_i = s_j$), we have found a duplicate. In\n",
    "    this case, we increment $j$ by 1 to continue scanning for the next\n",
    "    non-duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach works because the array is sorted, so any duplicate values must be\n",
    "adjacent in the array. The two pointers, $i$ and $j$, help us keep track of the\n",
    "\"processed\" part of the array (up to index $i$) and the \"unprocessed\" part (from\n",
