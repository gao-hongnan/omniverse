    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **_sorted in\n",
    "non-decreasing order_**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific\n",
    "`target` number. The two numbers are `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]`\n",
    "where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Return the indices of the two numbers_, `index1` and `index2`, **added by one**\n",
    "as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of _length 2_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may\n",
    "not** use the same element twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution must use only constant extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the given input array is sorted in non-decreasing order, we can make use\n",
    "of a\n",
    "[**two-pointer technique**](https://leetcode.com/articles/two-pointer-technique/).\n",
    "We start with one pointer at the beginning of the array and another at the end.\n",
    "We calculate the sum of the elements at the two pointer positions. If the sum\n",
    "equals the target, we have found our solution. If the sum is less than the\n",
    "target, we move the left pointer to the right (increasing the sum). If the sum\n",
    "is more than the target, we move the right pointer to the left (decreasing the\n",
    "sum). We continue this process until we find a solution or the pointers meet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Each given input will have exactly **one solution**.\n",
    "-   The **same element** cannot be used twice in the pair.\n",
    "-   The `numbers` array is **1-indexed** and sorted in **non-decreasing** order.\n",
    "-   All the elements in the `numbers` array are **integers**.\n",
    "-   The `target` is also an **integer**.\n",
    "-   The `numbers` array will at least have **two elements** (since we are\n",
    "    looking for a pair).\n",
    "-   Your solution must use only **constant extra space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It's assumed that the `numbers` array size is in the range of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    2 \\leq \\text{numbers.length} \\leq 3 \\times 10^4.\n",
    "    $$\n",

    "    -10^3 \\leq \\text{numbers[i]} \\leq 10^3.\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `target` is an integer in the range of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    -10^3 \\leq \\text{target} \\leq 10^3.\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `numbers` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "-   There is only **one valid answer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Constraints for?\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints for this problem are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The length of the `numbers` array is in the range of\n",
    "   $2 \\leq\n",
    "   \\text{numbers.length} \\leq 3 \\times 10^4$. This means that there\n",
    "   will be at least two numbers and at most 30,000 numbers in the array. This\n",
    "   helps us understand the potential size of the input and informs the\n",
    "   complexity of our solution. For example, a solution with a time complexity of\n",
    "   $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ might not be feasible, while a solution with a time\n",
    "   complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ or $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ would be\n",
    "   acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each number in the `numbers` array is an integer in the range of\n",
    "   $-1000 \\leq\n",
    "   \\text{numbers[i]} \\leq 1000$. This means that each number in\n",
    "   the array can be as low as -1000 and as high as 1000. Understanding the range\n",
    "   of numbers in the array can be important for avoiding potential issues with\n",
    "   integer overflow and for considering possible edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `target` is an integer in the range of\n",
    "   $-1000 \\leq \\text{target} \\leq\n",
    "   1000$. This informs us about the potential\n",
    "   values that the target sum can take. It's important to consider the range of\n",
    "   the target when thinking about possible edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `numbers` array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This means that each\n",
    "   number in the array is less than or equal to the next number. This\n",
    "   information is crucial because it allows us to use certain techniques (like\n",
    "   the two-pointer technique) that wouldn't work on an unsorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. This means\n",
    "   that there will always be exactly two numbers in the array that add up to the\n",
    "   target. This simplifies the problem because we don't have to consider cases\n",
    "   where there might be multiple pairs of numbers that sum to the target, or\n",
    "   cases where there is no pair that sums to the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these constraints give us important information about the size and\n",
    "nature of the input data, which can help us determine feasible approaches to\n",
    "solving the problem and anticipate potential edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Test Case 1: `numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`, Return: `[1, 2]`\n",
    "-   Test Case 2: `numbers = [2, 3, 4], target = 6`, Return: `[1, 3]`\n",
    "-   Test Case 3: `numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 18`, Return: `[2, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Edge Case 1: `numbers = [1, 2], target = 3`, Return: `[1, 2]` (Minimum size\n",
    "    array)\n",
    "-   Edge Case 2: `numbers = [-1, 0, 1, 2], target = 1`, Return: `[2, 3]`\n",
    "    (Negative numbers and zero)\n",
    "-   Edge Case 3: `numbers = [0, 0, 3, 4], target = 0`, Return: `[1, 2]` (Target\n",
    "    is zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Walkthrough / Whiteboarding\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider `numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize `left` pointer at index 1 and `right` pointer at index 4.\n",
    "2. Calculate the sum `numbers[left] + numbers[right] = 2 + 15 = 17`.\n",
    "3. Since the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer one step\n",
    "   to the left.\n",
    "4. Calculate the new sum `numbers[left] + numbers[right] = 2 + 11 = 13`.\n",
    "5. The sum is still greater than the target, move the `right` pointer one step\n",
    "   to the left.\n",
    "6. Calculate the new sum `numbers[left] + numbers[right] = 2 + 7 = 9`.\n",
    "7. The sum equals the target, return `[left, right] = [1, 2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Best Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical best time complexity for this problem is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, where\n",
    "$n$ is the length of the `numbers` array. This is because the most efficient\n",
    "solution to this problem involves traversing the array once, which requires\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Best Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical best (auxiliary) space complexity for this problem is\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(1)$. This is because we only use a constant amount of space to\n",
    "store the `left` and `right` pointers. We do not use any additional data\n",
    "structures that scale with the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given problem requires the solution to use only constant extra space. This\n",
    "constraint means that the space usage of our solution should not increase with\n",
    "the size of the input array. Our solution meets this requirement as it only uses\n",
    "two variables to keep track of the `left` and `right` pointers, irrespective of\n",
    "the size of the input array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space-Time Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no space-time tradeoff for this problem. This is because we cannot our\n",
    "space complexity is already at constant space, and our time complexity is\n",
    "already at linear time. We cannot improve either of these metrics without\n",
    "changing the problem itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the problem is solved using hashmap, then as compared to the brute force\n",
    "method, there indeed is a trade-off between space and time complexity (i.e.\n",
    "sacrificing space for time).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution (Two-Pointers Moving In Different Directions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an array $\\mathcal{A}$ sorted in ascending order and a target sum $t$.\n",
    "We seek to find a pair of elements $\\mathcal{A}[i]$ and $\\mathcal{A}[j]$ (where\n",

    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a two-pointer technique to solve this problem. The two pointers left\n",

    "$t$. If the sum is equal to $t$, we have found a solution and return the\n",
    "indices. If the sum is less than $t$, we increment left by one. If the sum is\n",
    "greater than $t$, we decrement right by one. We repeat this process until left\n",
    "and right are equal, at which point we have checked every pair of numbers.\n",

    "```{prf:algorithm} Two-Pointers\n",
    ":label: two-sum-167-two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted-two-pointers-algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-pointer algorithm operates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with two pointers, one at the beginning of the array (index $i$) and\n",
    "   one at the end (index $j$).\n",
    "2. Calculate the sum $\\mathcal{A}[i] + \\mathcal{A}[j]$.\n",
    "3. If the sum is equal to the target $t$, we have found a solution.\n",
    "4. If the sum is less than $t$, increment $i$.\n",
    "5. If the sum is greater than $t$, decrement $j$.\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 2-5 until $i = j$, at which point every pair has been checked.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Claim\n",
    "\n",
    "We make a more formal mathematical proof using the property of sorted arrays.\n",
    "The algorithm mentioned is often referred to as the \"two-pointer\" or \"two-sum\"\n",
    "method, and it works very efficiently on sorted arrays due to their inherent\n",
    "order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, let's clarify what we're aiming to prove:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:theorem} Claim\n",
    ":label: two-sum-167-two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted-two-pointers-claim\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claim:** Given an array $\\mathcal{A}$ sorted in ascending order and a target\n",
    "sum $t$, there exists a pair of elements $\\mathcal{A}[i]$ and $\\mathcal{A}[j]$\n",
    "(where $i \\neq j$) such that $\\mathcal{A}[i] + \\mathcal{A}[j] = t$ if and only\n",
    "if the two-pointer algorithm finds such a pair.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:proof}\n",
    "Assume that there is a solution to the problem, i.e., there exist indices $i^*$\n",
    "and $j^*$ (with $i^* < j^*$) such that\n",
    "$\\mathcal{A}[i^*] + \\mathcal{A}[j^*] = t$. This is also part of the assumption\n",
    "in the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contradiction, assume that the algorithm doesn't find this solution. Then, it\n",
    "must be the case that either $i$ was incremented past $i^*$ when $j$ was still\n",
    "greater than $j^*$, or $j$ was decremented past $j^*$ when $i$ was still less\n",
    "than $i^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, this means that for some $j' > j^*$, we had\n",
    "$\\mathcal{A}[i^*] + \\mathcal{A}[j'] < t$, and therefore $i$ was incremented.\n",
    "However, this contradicts the fact that $\\mathcal{A}$ is sorted in ascending\n",
    "order, as it implies that $\\mathcal{A}[j'] < \\mathcal{A}[j^*]$, which is not\n",
    "possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case, this means that for some $i' < i^*$, we had\n",
    "$\\mathcal{A}[i'] + \\mathcal{A}[j^*] > t$, and therefore $j$ was decremented.\n",
    "However, this contradicts the fact that $\\mathcal{A}$ is sorted in ascending\n",
    "order, as it implies that $\\mathcal{A}[i'] > \\mathcal{A}[i^*]$, which is not\n",
    "possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the algorithm must find a solution if it exists. This completes the\n",
    "proof.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the intuition behind the proof is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal{A} = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$ be a sorted array (ascending), and\n",
    "let $t$ be the target sum. Assume without loss of generality that there exists\n",
    "an unqiue solution pair $a_i + a_j = t$ where $i < j$. Then, the two-pointer\n",
    "algorithm will find this solution pair. Why so?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If for a given index pair $(k, l)$, we have $a_k + a_l < t$, then we know\n",
    "   that $a_k + a_m < t$ for all $m > l$. This is because the array is sorted in\n",
    "   ascending order, so $a_m > a_l$ for all $m > l$. Therefore, we can increment\n",
    "   $k$ to $k + 1$ and continue the search. If you were to instead decrement $l$\n",
    "   to $l - 1$, you will never find a solution pair, as the sum will only\n",
    "   decrease further.\n",
    "2. If for a given index pair $(k, l)$, we have $a_k + a_l > t$, then we know\n",
    "   that $a_m + a_l > t$ for all $m < k$. This is because the array is sorted in\n",
    "   ascending order, so $a_m < a_k$ for all $m < k$. Therefore, we can decrement\n",
    "   $l$ to $l - 1$ and continue the search. Similarly, if you were to instead\n",
    "   increment $k$ to $k + 1$, you will never find a solution pair, as the sum\n",
    "   will only increase further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without loss of generality, if our left pointer were to reach to index $i$\n",
    "first, and the right pointer is at index $l$ that is greater than $j$, then we\n",
    "know that then at this point in time, $a_i + a_l > t$ and based on the above\n",
    "argument, we just need to decrement $l$ to $l - 1$ to continue the search.\n",
