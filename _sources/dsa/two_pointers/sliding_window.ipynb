    "##### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, it seems like the time complexity of the above algorithm will\n",
    "be $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ where $n$ is the total number of elements in the input since\n",
    "we are iterating through each element of the input array up till $n-k+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a hidden factor in the above algorithm: the call to `sum` for each\n",
    "subarray of size $k$. Remember, the `sum` function takes $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ time\n",
    "for each subarray of size $k$. Therefore, the overall time complexity of our\n",
    "algorithm will become $\\mathcal{O}(n*k)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And let's consider where $k << n$, then the time complexity will still be\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(n)$ since $k$ is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $k$ is large or approaching $n$, then the time complexity will be\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$? Not really, since the maximum number of subarrays of size\n",
    "$k$ in an array of size $n$ is $n-k+1$. Therefore, the time complexity of our\n",
    "algorithm will be $\\mathcal{O}((n-k+1)*k)$, which is asymptotically equivalent\n",
    "to $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ which is same as $\\mathcal{O}(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case where $k=n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $k = n$, where $n$ is the length of the array, then there would only be one\n",
    "subarray of length $n$ (the entire array itself). Therefore, the algorithm would\n",
    "only need to compute the sum of this one subarray, which would result in a time\n",
    "complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, not $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the general case where $k < n$, the time complexity of the algorithm\n",
    "would be $\\mathcal{O}(n*k)$, because the algorithm needs to compute the sum of\n",
    "each possible subarray of length $k$ in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "So while the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(n*k)$,\n",
    "if $k = n$, the time complexity would actually be $\\mathcal{O}(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the above solution may not be faithful to the \"sliding window\"\n",
    "approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The space (auxiliary) complexity of the given `subarray_sum_fixed` function is\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(k)$, where $k$ is the size of the subarray being considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the space usage in the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `maximum` variable: This variable is used to track the maximum sum\n",
    "    encountered so far. Its space requirement is constant, as it only stores a\n",
    "    single integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `total_num` variable: This variable stores the total number of elements in\n",
    "    the `nums` list. Its space requirement is constant, as it only stores a\n",
    "    single integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `subarray` variable: This variable is used to store a subarray of size k. In\n",
    "    each iteration of the loop, a new subarray is created and stored in this\n",
    "    variable. The space requirement for the `subarray` variable is\n",
    "    $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ since it stores k elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `sum_` variable: This variable stores the sum of the elements in the\n",
    "    subarray. Its space requirement is constant, as it only stores a single\n",
    "    integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the dominant factor affecting the space complexity is the size of the\n",
    "subarray, which is $k$. Therefore, the space (auxiliary) complexity of the\n",
    "function is $\\mathcal{O}(k)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is a bit tricky since strictly speaking, the space complexity **_does\n",
    "not_** depend on the input size. It depends on the size of the subarray being\n",
    "considered, which is $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution 2 (Optimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach described is called a \"sliding window\" approach because we're\n",
    "essentially sliding a window of a fixed size (k) along the array, and\n",
    "calculating the sum of the elements within that window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We start by defining a window of size `k` at the leftmost part of the array.\n",
    "   The sum of the elements in this window is calculated and stored in a variable\n",
    "   called `window_sum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The maximum sum found so far, `largest`, is initially set to the\n",
    "   `window_sum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We then \"slide\" this window one position to the right. To calculate the new\n",
    "   `window_sum`, we add the value of the new element on the right and subtract\n",
    "   the value of the element that was previously on the leftmost position of the\n",
    "   window.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the new `window_sum` is larger than the `largest` sum found so far, we\n",
    "   update `largest` to be the new `window_sum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until we've slid the window to the end of the array. The\n",
    "   `largest` sum at the end of this process is the largest sum of `k`\n",
    "   consecutive elements in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an array [1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2] and `k = 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning, our window of size 5 includes the elements [1, 3, 2, 6, -1].\n",
    "The `window_sum` is 11 (1+3+2+6-1). So initially, `largest = window_sum = 11`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The window slides to the right to include the next element 4 and exclude the\n",
    "leftmost element 1. Now, the window includes the elements [3, 2, 6, -1, 4]. The\n",
    "new `window_sum` is 14 (11 - 1 + 4), which is larger than `largest`, so we\n",
    "update `largest` to 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue this process until we reach the end of the array. The final\n",
    "`largest` value will be the maximum sum of `k` consecutive elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a diagram to illustrate this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Array: [1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2]\n",
    "k = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Window position              window_sum       largest\n",
    "{1, 3, 2, 6, -1}, 4, 1, 8, 2     11               11\n",
    "1, {3, 2, 6, -1, 4}, 1, 8, 2     14               14\n",
    "1, 3, {2, 6, -1, 4, 1}, 8, 2     12               14\n",
    "1, 3, 2, {6, -1, 4, 1, 8}, 2     18               18\n",
    "1, 3, 2, 6, {-1, 4, 1, 8, 2}     14               18\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, the maximum sum of 5 consecutive elements in the array is 18.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that that the total number of subarrays of size $k$ in an\n",
    "array of size $n$ is $n-k+1$. Why? Because the first subarray of size $k$ will\n",
    "start at index 0 and end at index $k-1$. The second subarray of size $k$ will\n",
    "start at index 1 and end at index $k$. The third subarray of size $k$ will start\n",
    "at index 2 and end at index $k+1$. And so on. The last subarray of size $k$ will\n",
    "start at index $n-k$ and end at index $n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the total number of subarrays of size $k$ in an array of size $n$ is\n",
    "$n - k + 1$. This is because for each starting index of the subarray, we \"shift\"\n",
    "it one position to the right, until we reach the point where the end of the\n",
    "subarray is at the last index of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a visualization for better understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an array of size $n = 7$ and we want subarrays of size $k = 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Array: [a, b, c, d, e, f, g]\n",
    "\n",
    "Subarrays of size 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [a, b, c], d, e, f, g (starts at index 0, ends at index 2)\n",
    "2. a, [b, c, d], e, f, g (starts at index 1, ends at index 3)\n",
    "3. a, b, [c, d, e], f, g (starts at index 2, ends at index 4)\n",
    "4. a, b, c, [d, e, f], g (starts at index 3, ends at index 5)\n",
    "5. a, b, c, d, [e, f, g] (starts at index 4, ends at index 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the last subarray starts at index $n - k = 7 - 3 = 4$ and ends\n",
    "at index $n - 1 = 6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have 5 subarrays of size 3 in an array of size 7, which matches with the\n",
    "formula $n - k + 1 = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5$.\n",

    "S = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "## The Sliding Window Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "The sliding window technique, a specific application of the two pointers\n",
    "technique, is an algorithmic strategy used to solve a variety of problems that\n",
    "involve searching for subsequences in an array or list that satisfy a particular\n",
    "condition. The so-called \"window\" is defined by two pointers or indices into the\n",
    "array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalized Sliding Window Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a sequence $S = [s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n]$ of $n$ elements where\n",
    "$s*i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. We define two pointers, $i$ and\n",
    "$j$ (with $1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq n$), which demarcate the boundaries of the\n",
    "\"window\". This window represents a contiguous subsequence\n",
    "$s_i, s*{i+1}, \\ldots, s_j$ of the sequence, or more commonly denoted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S[i:j] = [s_i, s*{i+1}, \\ldots, s_j]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is often to find a window that satisfies a specific condition\n",
    "$C(S, i, j)$. This condition is a function of the sequence and the current\n",
    "window, and varies depending on the problem. At the start, we set $i = j = 1$,\n",
    "which corresponds to a window that only includes the first element of the\n",
    "sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then iteratively adjust the positions of $i$ and $j$ based on the condition\n",
    "$C$ and the specific problem requirements. This process continues until we meet\n",
    "a suitable stopping condition. This is often when the right pointer $j$ has\n",
    "traversed the entire sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixed Window Size Sliding Window Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fixed-size sliding window technique, we start by determining the window\n",
    "size $k$. The window is defined by the pointers $i$ and $j$ such that\n",
    "$j - i + 1 = k$, and it remains constant throughout the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decide the window size $k$.\n",
    "2. Initialize $i = 1$ and $j = k$.\n",
    "3. Repeat the following until a stopping condition is met (usually $j > n$):\n",
    "    - Evaluate $C(S, i, j)$ and process the window as needed.\n",
    "    - Increment both $i$ and $j$ synchronously to slide the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this variant, the window slides through the sequence as $i$ and $j$ are\n",
    "incremented together, maintaining the same size $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Window Size Sliding Window Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "In the variable-size sliding window technique, the size of the window can change\n",
    "dynamically during the execution of the algorithm. When the condition $C$ is\n",
    "satisfied, we expand the window by incrementing $j$. When the condition $C$ is\n",
    "not satisfied, we shrink the window from the left by incrementing $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize $i = j = 1$.\n",
    "2. Repeat the following until a stopping condition is met (usually $j > n$):\n",
    "    - If $C(S, i, j)$ is satisfied, increment $j$ to expand the window.\n",
    "    - Else, increment $i$ to shrink the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "This variant allows for more flexibility and is often useful in problems where\n",
    "the optimal window size is not known beforehand and depends on the specific\n",
    "condition $C$."
