    "constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance describes a relationship between types where a type `T` is considered\n",
    "a subtype of a type `U` (written as `T ≤ U`) if and only if a container of `T`\n",
    "(`Container[T]`) is considered a subtype of a container of `U` (`Container[U]`).\n",
    "This is natural for operations that produce or return values of the generic type\n",
    "(e.g., getters). In the context of our example, `List[int] ≤ List[float]` would\n",
    "hold true if `List[T]` were covariant, meaning that a list of integers could be\n",
    "used wherever a list of floats is expected, because every integer can be\n",
    "considered a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this relationship does not hold because the `append` method of a\n",
    "`List[float]` can accept any `float` as an argument, while `append` for a\n",
    "`List[int]` can only accept `int` values. Since appending a `float` to a\n",
    "`List[int]` is not type-safe (a float is not necessarily an int), the `List`\n",
    "type cannot be considered covariant. More concretely, if we assume that\n",
    "`List[int]` is indeed a subtype of `List[float]`, then the append method of\n",
    "`List[int]` should do **_exactly_** the same thing as the append method of\n",
    "`List[float]`. But this is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contravariance\n",
    "\n",
    "Contravariance is the opposite: `T ≤ U` implies `Container[U] ≤ Container[T]`.\n",
    "This makes sense for containers that consume or operate on the generic type\n",
    "(e.g., setters). Using our example, `List[float] ≤ List[int]` would be true if\n",
    "`List[T]` were contravariant, meaning you could use a list expecting floats\n",
    "where a list of integers is required. This is because it's safe to pass an\n",
    "integer where a float is expected, not the other way around.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example illustrates that this relationship also doesn't hold because the\n",
    "`pop` method returns a more specific type (`int`) in `List[int]` than in\n",
    "`List[float]` (which returns `float`). If `List[T]` were contravariant, we would\n",
    "expect operations that work on `List[int]` to work on `List[float]`, but the\n",
    "narrower return type of `pop()` in `List[int]` contradicts this, making it not\n",
    "contravariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invariance\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the `List` type is neither covariant nor contravariant as\n",
    "demonstrated, it is termed invariant. Invariance means that you cannot\n",
    "substitute `List[T]` with `List[U]` or vice versa unless `T` and `U` are exactly\n",
    "the same type. In practical terms, a `List[int]` is only a `List[int]` and\n",
    "cannot be treated as a `List[float]`, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Connection of Mutability and Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance, by definition, allows a type `C[Derived]` to be treated as `C[Base]`\n",
    "if `Derived` is a subtype of `Base`. This implies that wherever a `Base` is\n",
    "expected, a `Derived` can be used without issue, preserving the \"is-a\"\n",
    "relationship and ensuring that any operation that expects `Base` can work with\n",
    "`Derived`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with immutable structures, the operations you can perform on them\n",
    "are **read-only**. Since you cannot modify an immutable structure, you can't\n",
    "perform any operation that might violate the type constraints that covariance\n",
    "imposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Mutation Means No Type Violations**: Since you cannot add, remove, or\n",
    "   change the elements of an immutable structure, there's no risk of inserting\n",
    "   an element of an incorrect type that might violate the expected type of the\n",
    "   container.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Read-Only Operations Are Safe**: Operations on immutable structures are\n",
    "   limited to reading or deriving new structures without altering the original.\n",
    "   This means any operation that works on `C[Base]` will also work on\n",
    "   `C[Derived]` because it only relies on the presence of `Base` type behaviors\n",
    "   in `Derived`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Substitution Principle Is Preserved**: The Liskov Substitution Principle,\n",
    "   which is central to understanding subtype relationships, states that objects\n",
    "   of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without\n",
    "   affecting the correctness of the program. Immutability ensures that this\n",
    "   principle is not violated since the operations allowed on an immutable\n",
    "   `C[Derived]` would not behave any differently if `C[Derived]` were replaced\n",
    "   with `C[Base]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For mutable structures, the same logic does not apply because the ability to\n",
    "modify the structure (e.g., adding or removing elements) introduces the\n",
    "possibility of violating type constraints. If you were allowed to treat a\n",
    "mutable container of `Derived` as a mutable container of `Base` (covariance),\n",
    "you could insert a `Base` instance into what is actually a container of\n",
    "`Derived`, breaking the type safety of the container.\n",
