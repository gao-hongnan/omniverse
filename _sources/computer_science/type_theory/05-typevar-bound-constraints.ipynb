    "## Upper Bounding Type Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bounds** specify an upper bound for the type variable. This means that the\n",
    "type variable can represent any type that is a subtype of the specified bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Syntax**: `T = TypeVar('T', bound=SuperType)`\n",
    "-   **Meaning**: The type variable `T` can be any type that is a subtype of\n",
    "    `SuperType` (including `SuperType` itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "The excerpt discusses how to enforce type constraints in Python using the\n",
    "`TypeVar` function from the `typing` module, focusing on the concept of an upper\n",
    "bound. Here's a more structured explanation for clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Type Variables with Upper Bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python's type hinting system, you can define a type variable that restricts\n",
    "which types can be used in place of it by specifying an upper bound. This is\n",
    "done using the `bound=<type>` argument in the `TypeVar` function. The key point\n",
    "is that any type that replaces this type variable must be a subtype of the\n",
    "specified boundary type. It's important to note that the boundary type itself\n",
    "cannot be another type variable or a parameterized type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Ensuring Type Safety with `Sized`\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the `Sized` protocol from Python's `typing` module, which represents\n",
    "any type that supports the `len()` function. We define a type variable `ST` with\n",
    "`Sized` as its upper bound:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import TypeVar, Sized\n",
    "\n",
    "ST = TypeVar('ST', bound=Sized)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition means that `ST` can be replaced by any type that has a `len()`\n",
    "method, ensuring that objects of type `ST` can be measured for their size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `longer` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of type `ST`. It\n",
    "returns the object with the greater length:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def longer(x: ST, y: ST) -> ST:\n",
    "    if len(x) > len(y):\n",
    "        return x\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `ST` is bound to `Sized`, we can safely use `len()` on `x` and `y`. This\n",
    "allows the function to work with any sized collection, such as lists or sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `longer([1], [1, 2])` correctly returns the longer list, with the return\n",
    "    type being `List[int]`.\n",
    "-   `longer({1}, {1, 2})` operates on sets, returning the larger set as\n",
    "    `Set[int]`.\n",
    "-   The statement about `longer([1], {1, 2})` being okay and returning a type\n",
    "    `Collection[int]` is correct as well. This is because unlike constraints, we\n",
    "    do not need both `x` and `y` to be of the same exact type, they just need to\n",
    "    be subclass of the bound super type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bounding and Semantic Clarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Bounding also offers more clarity and semantic meaning, than say, an `Union`\n",
    "type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "AnimalType = TypeVar(\"AnimalType\", bound=Animal)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_with_bound(arg: AnimalType) -> AnimalType:\n",
    "    return arg\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_with_union(arg: Union[Dog, Cat, Car]) -> Union[Dog, Cat, Car]:\n",
    "    return arg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In `function_with_bound`, the argument arg must be an instance of `Animal` or a\n",
    "subclass of `Animal`. This means you could pass in an instance of `Dog` or\n",
    "`Cat`, but not `Car`, because `Car` is not a subclass of `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `function_with_union`, the argument arg can be an instance of `Dog`, `Cat`,\n",
    "or `Car`. There's no requirement that these types are related in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bound versus Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Bounds** are used to specify that a type variable must be a subtype of a\n",
    "    particular type. This is akin to setting an upper limit (or in some\n",
    "    contexts, a lower limit) on what the type variable can be. The purpose of\n",
    "    bounds is to ensure that the type variable adheres to a hierarchical type\n",
    "    constraint, typically ensuring that it inherits certain methods or\n",
    "    properties.\n",
    "-   **Constraints**, on the other hand, specify a list of explicit types that a\n",
    "    type variable can represent, without implying any hierarchical relationship\n",
    "    between them. The purpose of constraints is to allow a type variable to be\n",
    "    more flexible by being one of several types, rather than restricting it to a\n",
    "    subtype of a specific class or interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison is pretty superficial but something to remember is that you can\n",
    "mix types within arguments if you use bound, which behaves a little like\n",
    "`Union`, whereas in constraint, all arguments must be of the exact same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "AnimalType = TypeVar(\"AnimalType\", bound=Animal)\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_with_bound(arg1: AnimalType, arg2: AnimalType) -> Tuple[AnimalType, AnimalType]:\n",
    "    return arg1, arg2\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "tabby = Cat()\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "_, _ = function_with_bound(cat, dog)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This above code will not raise any issue when compared to the below code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "AnimalType = TypeVar(\"AnimalType\", Cat, Dog)\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_with_bound(arg1: AnimalType, arg2: AnimalType) -> Tuple[AnimalType, AnimalType]:\n",
    "    return arg1, arg2\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "tabby = Cat()\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "_, _ = function_with_bound(cat, dog)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because if we use constraint, our contract is that within the scope, all\n",
    "arguments must be of type `AnimalType`, whereas when in bound, `arg1` and `arg2`\n",
    "can be different, as long as both are upper bounded by `Animal`.\n",
