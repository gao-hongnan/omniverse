    "\n",
    "Let's first examine why unconstrained type variables can lead to issues, a\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import TypeVar\n",
    "\n",
    "T = TypeVar(\"T\")\n",
    "\n",

    "    return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "These errors occur because `TypeVar(\"T\")` is _**unconstrained**_, and this\n",
    "_means_ `T` can represent literally any type, and not all type can do `add`. Why\n",
    "so? Because for `+` operator, the underlying object must implement the `__add__`\n",
    "method. For instance, two dictionaries cannot be added together because their\n",
    "`__add__` is not well defined. This error that `mypy` raised forces you to\n",

    "\n",
    "What does this even mean? Type binding is the association of a type variable\n",

    "#### Type Variables And Substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the earlier example of `add` function, and see how type binding works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In line 6, we declared `T` as\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Say we invoke the function `add(a=x, b=y)` where `x` and `y` are of some\n",
    "    type.\n",
    "-   Let `type(x)` be denoted as $T_x$ and `type(y)` be denoted as $T_y$.\n",
    "-   For the checker to pass, we must abide by:\n",
    "    -   $T_x$ must be one of the types defined in the set\n",
    "        `{int, float, NDArray[np.float64]}`.\n",
    "    -   $T_y$ must be one of the types defined in the set\n",
    "        `{int, float, NDArray[np.float64]}`.\n",

    "TypeVar provides stronger compile-time guarantees and ensures type consistency\n",

    "for each approach above, my guess is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Union types:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. For each argument `x`, the type checker will check if `x` is of any of\n",

    "       will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Constrained TypeVar:\n",
    "    1. First occurrence of `T` is checked against the set of types defined in\n",
    "       the `TypeVar` declaration.\n",
    "    2. If the type of the first occurrence of `T` is not in the set, then the\n",
    "       type checker will raise an error.\n",
    "    3. If the type of the first occurrence of `T` is in the set, then `T` is\n",

    "-   **Concrete**: `T = TypeVar(\"T\", bound=BaseModel)` means `T` can be any type\n",
    "    that is a subclass of `BaseModel` (from `pydantic`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Type Variables with Upper Bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python's type hinting system, you can define a type variable that restricts\n",
    "which types can be used in place of it by specifying an upper bound. This is\n",
    "done using the `bound=<type>` argument in the `TypeVar` function. The key point\n",
    "is that any type that replaces this type variable must be a subtype of the\n",
    "specified boundary type.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the boundary type itself cannot be another type\n",
    "variable or a parameterized type. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# NOT ALLOWED!\n",
    "T1 = TypeVar(\"T1\")\n",
    "T2 = TypeVar(\"T2\", bound=T1)        # Cannot use T1 as a bound\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You also cannot use a parameterized generic type as a bound. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is NOT allowed\n",
    "from typing import List\n",
    "T = TypeVar('T', bound=List[int])   # Error! Can't use List[int] as a bound\n",

    "# This is NOT allowed either\n",
    "S = TypeVar('S')\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Motivation, Simple Length Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to write a function that compares the lengths of two\n",
    "sequences.\n",
    "\n",

    "### A Case Study On `Sized`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can fix this using `bound` to ensure our type variable only accepts types\n",
    "that support `len()`. Consider the `Sized` protocol from Python's `typing`\n",
    "module, which represents any type that supports the `len()` function. We define\n",
    "a type variable `ST` with `Sized` as its upper bound:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import TypeVar, Sized\n",
    "\n",
    "ST = TypeVar(\"ST\", bound=Sized)\n",

    "def longer(x: ST, y: ST) -> ST:\n",
    "    return x if len(x) > len(y) else y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `ST` is bound to `Sized`, we can safely use `len()` on `x` and `y`. This\n",
    "allows the function to work with any sized collection, such as lists or sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `longer([1], [1, 2])` correctly returns the longer list, with the return\n",
    "    type being `List[int]`.\n",

    "## Bound versus Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Bounds** are used to specify that a type variable must be a subtype of a\n",
    "    particular type. This is akin to setting an upper limit (or in some\n",
    "    contexts, a lower limit) on what the type variable can be. The purpose of\n",
    "    bounds is to ensure that the type variable adheres to a hierarchical type\n",
    "    constraint, typically ensuring that it inherits certain methods or\n",
    "    properties.\n",
    "-   **Constraints**, on the other hand, specify a list of explicit types that a\n",
    "    type variable can represent, without implying any hierarchical relationship\n",
    "    between them. The purpose of constraints is to allow a type variable to be\n",
    "    more flexible by being one of several types, rather than restricting it to a\n",
    "    subtype of a specific class or interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison is pretty superficial but something to remember is that you can\n",
    "mix types within arguments if you use bound, which behaves a little like\n",
    "`Union`, whereas in constraint, all arguments must be of the exact same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "AnimalType = TypeVar(\"AnimalType\", bound=Animal)\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_with_bound(arg1: AnimalType, arg2: AnimalType) -> Tuple[AnimalType, AnimalType]:\n",
    "    return arg1, arg2\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "tabby = Cat()\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "_, _ = function_with_bound(cat, dog)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This above code will not raise any issue when compared to the below code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "AnimalType = TypeVar(\"AnimalType\", Cat, Dog)\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_with_bound(arg1: AnimalType, arg2: AnimalType) -> Tuple[AnimalType, AnimalType]:\n",
    "    return arg1, arg2\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "tabby = Cat()\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "_, _ = function_with_bound(cat, dog)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because if we use constraint, our contract is that within the scope, all\n",
    "arguments must be of type `AnimalType`, whereas when in bound, `arg1` and `arg2`\n",
    "can be different, as long as both are upper bounded by `Animal`.\n",
