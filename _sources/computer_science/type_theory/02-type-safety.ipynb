    "## Type Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "A subtype is a foundational concept in type theory and object-oriented\n",
    "programming that facilitates type safety and polymorphism. The relationship\n",
    "between a subtype $S$ and a supertype $T$ is denoted as $S <: T$,\n",
    "$S \\subseteq T$, or $S ≤: T$. Before we detail the\n",
    "**_criterion_**[^what-is-a-criterion] for subtype in the next section, we state\n",
    "an important implication of subtype - type safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:definition} Subtype and Type Safety\n",
    ":label: type-theory-subtype-and-type-safety\n",
    "\n",
    "If $S$ is a subtype of $T$, the subtyping\n",
    "[relation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics)>) (written as\n",
    "$S \\leq T$, $S <: T$, $S \\subseteq T$, or $S \\leq: T$) means that any term of\n",
    "**type** $S$ can **safely** be used in any **context** where a term of **type**\n",
    "$T$ is **expected**.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we say that $S$ is a **_subtype_** of $T$ **_if a piece of code\n",
    "written for variables of type_** $T$ **_can also safely be used on variables of\n",
    "type_** $S$ [^cs2040s-variable-and-type].\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if $S$ is a subtype of $T$, you can use an instance of $S$ in\n",
    "any place where an instance of $T$ is required, without any issues related to\n",
    "type compatibility. That is what we call **subtype polymorphism**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept of subtyping forms the basis of subtype polymorphism in\n",
    "object-oriented programming. Subtype polymorphism allows objects of a subtype to\n",
    "be treated as objects of a supertype, enabling methods to operate on objects of\n",
    "different types as long as they share a common supertype. This mechanism is\n",
    "critical for implementing interfaces and abstract classes in a type-safe manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, in subtype polymorphism, if $S$ is a subtype of $T$ (denoted as\n",
    "$S <: T$), then objects of type $S$ can be used in contexts expecting objects of\n",
    "type $T$. This interoperability is guaranteed without loss of integrity or\n",
    "behavior of the original type $S$, ensuring that operations performed on $T$ are\n",
    "valid on $S$. This allows for greater flexibility and code reuse while\n",
    "maintaining strict type safety, as it ensures that the substitutability of\n",
    "subtypes for their supertypes does not lead to runtime type errors or unexpected\n",
    "behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Type Safe Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume for a moment that the class `Cat` and `Dog` are both valid _subtype_ of\n",
    "the class `Animal` through class inheritance, which we have learned earlier to\n",
    "be called [**nominal subtyping**](../type_theory/01-subtypes.md) (i.e.\n",
    "subclasses are subtypes)."
