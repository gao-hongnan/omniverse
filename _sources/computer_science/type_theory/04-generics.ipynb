    "## Generics and Type Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generics\n",
    "\n",
    "Generics enable the construction of new, more specific types from abstract type\n",
    "definitions by using what are known as **generic type constructors**. These\n",
    "constructors operate at the type level, similar to how functions operate at the\n",
    "value level.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Generic Type**: A generic type is a type definition that includes one or\n",
    "    more type variables. It's a template from which concrete types can be\n",
    "    constructed. For example, `Tuple[T]` or more broadly `Tuple[T, ...]` (using\n",
    "    Python's typing syntax) is the generic type. It's not `Tuple` itself that's\n",
    "    the generic type, but rather `Tuple` parameterized with type variables like\n",
    "    `T` or with specific types (we usually call the realization of the generic\n",
    "    type as a _parameterized type_[^2] (concrete type)).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Generic Type Constructor**: This term refers to the mechanism by which\n",
    "    generic types like `Tuple[T, ...]` are used to create new, parameterized\n",
    "    types. The constructor takes a type (or types) as an argument and \"returns\"\n",
    "    a new parameterized type based on the generic definition. For instance, when\n",
    "    you use `Tuple[float, ...]`, you're invoking the generic type constructor of\n",
    "    `Tuple` with `float` as the argument, resulting in a new parameterized type\n",
    "    that can be thought of as a vector of floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two examples illustrating this concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Example**: When `Tuple` is parameterized with `float` and an\n",
    "   ellipsis (`...`) indicating a variable length, `Tuple[float, ...]` acts as a\n",
    "   parameterized type that could represent a mathematical vector of floats. In\n",
    "   this scenario, `Tuple[float, ...]` is a parameterized type derived from the\n",
    "   generic type `Tuple[T, ...]` by specifying `float` as the type argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Registry Example**: Similarly, by parameterizing `Tuple` with another type,\n",
    "   such as `UserID` (assuming `UserID` is a type you've defined elsewhere),\n",
    "   `Tuple[UserID, ...]` becomes a parameterized type that could represent a\n",
    "   registry of user IDs. Again, `Tuple[UserID, ...]` is a parameterized type\n",
    "   constructed from the generic type `Tuple[T, ...]` using `UserID` as the type\n",
    "   argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such semantics is known as _generic type constructor_, which is similar to the\n",
    "semantics of functions, where a function takes a value and returns a value. In\n",
    "this case, a generic type constructor takes a type and returns a type[^3].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Variable and Type Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "A **type variable** is a placeholder used in generic programming to denote a\n",
    "type that is not specified at the point of declaration but will be determined\n",
    "later, at the time of use. Type variables allow the definition of generic types\n",
    "or functions that can operate on any data type. They are essentially the\n",
    "variables of type expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **type parameter** is similar to a type variable, but the term is often used\n",
    "in the context of defining generic classes, interfaces, or methods. The type\n",
    "parameter is declared as a part of a generic type or method definition and\n",
    "specifies a placeholder that will be replaced with an actual type when the\n",
    "generic type is instantiated or the generic method is invoked. It allows for the\n",
    "creation of parameterized types or methods where the specific type(s) to be used\n",
    "are specified when a class is instantiated or a method is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `T` defined via `TypeVar` is a type variable, and it is a placeholder for\n",
    "the actual type that will be used when the function is called. For instance,\n",
    "looking at the function below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "T = TypeVar('T')\n",
    "\n",
    "def append_and_return_list(list_: List[T], element: T) -> List[T]:\n",
    "    list_.append(element)\n",
    "    return list_\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not know what `T` is at the time of defining the function, but we know\n",
    "that `T` will be a type of the list and the element when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Argument\n",
    "\n",
    "A **type argument** refers to the concrete type that is supplied in place of a\n",
    "type variable or parameter when a generic class, interface, or method is\n",
    "actually used. It effectively \"fills in\" the generic placeholder with a specific\n",
    "type, thereby instantiating or invoking the generic entity with that specific\n",
    "type. The type argument provides the actual type information that allows the\n",
    "generic mechanism to operate on specific data types, ensuring type safety and\n",
    "consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a generic class `List[T]`, if you create a new instance with\n",
    "`new List[int]()`, the `int` is the type argument replacing the type parameter\n",
    "`T` for that specific instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the earlier example of the `append_and_return_list` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "T = TypeVar('T')\n",
    "\n",
    "def append_and_return_list(list_: List[T], element: T) -> List[T]:\n",
    "    list_.append(element)\n",
    "    return list_\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we invoke this function, we supply type arguments through the types of the\n",
    "arguments passed to the function. If we call `append_and_return_list` with a\n",
    "list of integers and an integer element:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list_of_ints: List[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "new_list_of_ints: List[int] = append_and_return_list(list_=list_of_ints, element=6)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `int` serves as the type argument for `T`. The generic `T` in the\n",
    "function's definition is replaced by `int`, making the function operate\n",
    "specifically on a list of integers. The type argument ensures that the generic\n",
    "function can be applied to a specific data type, in this context, integers,\n",
    "thereby tailoring the generic function to a particular use case while preserving\n",
    "type safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pair Problem Revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve the issues with the `Pair` class in the motivation, we can use type\n",
    "variables to parameterize the `Pair` class. This will allow us to specify the\n",
    "types of the `first` and `second` attributes, as well as the return types of the\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's walk through an example[^4] to find out.\n",

    "Consider a function that adds two _things_ (not necessarily numbers) together.\n",

    "def add(x, y):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And injecting `x` and `y` is the act of parameterizing the function with what we\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, we want to type hint the `add` function. You may likely do the following:\n",

    "def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
