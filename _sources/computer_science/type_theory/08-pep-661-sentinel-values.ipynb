    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by OpenAI's approaches in software development and type handling, this\n",
    "discussion explores the concept of sentinel types, a powerful technique in for\n",
    "representing unique default values or states. Sentinel types are particularly\n",
    "useful in scenarios where `None` might be a valid input value, necessitating a\n",
    "distinct marker for \"no value given\" cases. In fact, `None` is in itself a form\n",
    "of sentinel value, a singleton object that represents the absence of a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this exploration introduces the core idea as formalized in\n",
    "[PEP 661 – Sentinel Values](https://peps.python.org/pep-0661/), which advocates\n",
    "for a standardized approach to sentinel values in Python, we'll steer clear of\n",
    "the more formalized specifics. Readers interested in a deeper dive into the\n",
    "formal aspects of sentinel types are encouraged to consult the original\n",
    "[PEP 661 – Sentinel Values](https://peps.python.org/pep-0661/) for comprehensive\n",
    "insights and technical details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `NotGiven`\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI's own implementation of a sentinel type, `NotGiven`, was introduced\n",
    "[here in OpenAI's GitHub repository](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/7367256070a975921ed4430f55d17dc0a9319f21/src/openai/_types.py#L273)."

    "### Purpose and Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of such sentinels indicates that a parameter was not provided at all.\n",
    "It's used to distinguish between a parameter being explicitly set to `None` and\n",
    "not being provided. Structurally, both `None` and `NotGiven` are singleton\n",
    "instances and are considered \"falsy\" in boolean contexts. This allows them to be\n",
    "used in conditional statements to check if a value was provided or not. The\n",
    "singleton property ensures that all instances of `NotGiven` are equal to each\n",
    "other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case 1. Timeouts in HTTP Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentinel pattern like `NotGiven` is common in APIs where default behavior is\n",
    "triggered when a parameter is not given, but `None` might be a valid, meaningful\n",
    "input. For example, `None` might mean \"disable timeout\", while `NotGiven` means\n",
    "\"use a default timeout\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider you implemented a function `get` (not to be confused with the method\n",
    "`get` from the `requests` library) to make HTTP requests, the `timeout`\n",
    "parameter specifies the maximum number of seconds to wait for a response. If\n",
    "`timeout` is set to `None`, it means that there is no timeout limit for the\n",
    "request. In other words, the request will wait indefinitely until the server\n",
    "responds or the connection is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use a relatively simple example to illustrate. Consider the\n",
    "following function call `get` that takes in a argument `timeout` that defines\n",
    "how many seconds to wait before raising a `TimeoutError`. If user specifies\n",
    "`None`, it means that this program should have no timeout, and therefore should\n",
    "run indefinitely until a server or something responds to halt."

    "   from the absence of a value. The `NotGiven` singleton allows you to\n",
    "   differentiate between a user explicitly passing `None` (which might have a\n",
    "   specific intended behavior) and not passing any value at all.\n",
    "2. **Default Behavior Control:** By using a sentinel like `NotGiven`, we can\n",
    "   implement a default behavior that is only triggered when an argument is\n",
    "   **not** provided. This is different from setting a default value in the\n",
    "   function definition, as it allows the function to check if the user has\n",
    "   explicitly set the argument, even if it's set to `None`.\n",
    "3. **Semantic Clarity:** In complex APIs or libraries, using a sentinel value\n",
    "   can provide clearer semantics. It makes the intention of the code more\n",
    "   explicit, both for the developer and for users of the API. It indicates that\n",
    "   thought has been given to the different states an argument can be in, and\n",
    "   different behaviors are intentionally designed for each state."
