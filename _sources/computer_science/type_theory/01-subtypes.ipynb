    "This distinction is fundamental in understanding how different programming\n",
    "languages conceptualize and implement **subtype relationships**. **_Nominal\n",
    "subtyping_** bases the subtype relationship on **explicit declarations** (like\n",

    "\n",
    "Given the backdrop in the previous section, we would condense out the key\n",
    "concepts of nominal subtyping below, and end it off with a python example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Nominal Subtyping?\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Nominal subtyping_** is a type system concept where a type is considered a\n",
    "subtype of another **only if it is explicitly declared as such**. This mechanism\n",
    "is rooted in **explicit declarations** of type relationships, typically through\n",
    "class inheritance in object-oriented programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Nominal Subtyping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal subtyping provides a **controlled environment for polymorphism**, where\n",
    "the relationships between types are **well-defined** and **restricted according\n",
    "to the class hierarchy**. Consequently, the _explicitness_ of such declaration\n",
    "provides clarity to developers. Furthermore, nominal subtype relationships need\n",
    "to be planned in advance, and hence it might be easier to ensure that certain\n",
    "principles (e.g, the Liskov substitution principle) hold for subtypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Implement Nominal Subtyping?\n",
    "\n",
    "In languages that utilize **_nominal subtyping_**, **subclassing** or\n",
    "**interface implementation** are the primary means to establish subtype\n",
    "relationships. For instance, a class must **explicitly extend another class** or\n",
    "**implement an interface** to be considered its subtype. This approach relies on\n",
    "the **lineage of type declarations** to determine subtype relationships,\n",
    "focusing on **names and declarations** rather than the structural content of the\n",
    "types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java for instance, if `class Dog extends Animal`, **_Dog_** is a **_nominal\n",
    "subtype_** of **_Animal_** because it **explicitly extends** `Animal`. We see a\n",
    "similar implementation in Python below, detailing how `Dog` and `Cat` are both\n",
    "subtypes of their parent class `Animal` through inheritance."

    "[post](https://appmaster.io/blog/interface-implementation-go) that summarizes\n",
    "some of thees rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inclusive vs. Coercive Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "While nominal and structural subtyping focus on _how_ type relationships are\n",
    "defined, **inclusive** and **coercive** implementations concern themselves with\n",
    "_what happens_ when types **interact** in a program, specifically how values of\n",
    "one type are treated or converted to another type within the subtype\n",
    "relationship[^subtype-schemes-wikipedia].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inclusive Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "The **basic idea** of _inclusive implementations_ is that the internal\n",
    "representation of a value from a subtype is compatible with that of its\n",
    "supertype. This means that the value itself doesn't need to change or be\n",
    "converted when treated as a value of the supertype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this as direct **\"plug-and-play\"**. A subtype is a special case of the\n",
    "supertype and can directly be used in any context where the supertype is\n",
    "expected. No transformation or special handling is needed; the system inherently\n",
    "understands that the subtype fits because its representation **includes all\n",
    "necessary aspects** of the supertype.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if you have a subtype $\\mathcal{A}$ and a supertype\n",
    "$\\mathcal{B}$, any value that belongs to $\\mathcal{A}$ is also valid as a value\n",
    "of $\\mathcal{B}$. The representation of the value in $\\mathcal{A}$ is sufficient\n",
    "to represent it in $\\mathcal{B}$ as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:example} Inclusive Implementations in Object-Oriented Languages\n",
    ":label: type-theory-01-subtypes-example-inclusive-impl-oop\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a class hierarchy where `Dog` extends `Animal`. A `Dog` object has all\n",
    "the characteristics (fields, methods) of an `Animal` and possibly more. When you\n",
    "treat a `Dog` object as an `Animal` (for example, passing it to a function that\n",
    "expects an `Animal`), no conversion is needed - the `Dog` object 'fits' into the\n",
    "`Animal` type because it already includes all aspects of an `Animal`. This very\n",
    "much sounds like the nominal subtyping we discussed earlier.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coercive Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, coercive implementations involve automatically converting a\n",
    "value from one type to another when necessary. This conversion is typically\n",
    "needed when the internal representations of the types are different. Imagine\n",
    "this as needing an \"adapter\" to make one type fit into the context of another.\n",
    "The system recognizes that while the two types are not the same, there's a known\n",
    "way to convert from one to the other so that interactions can proceed smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To formalize the concept of coercive implementations in the context of subtypes\n",
    "and supertypes with mathematical logic, we consider two types, $\\mathcal{A}$ and\n",
    "$\\mathcal{B}$, not necessary subtype of each other. The coercive implementation\n",
    "implies that values of type $\\mathcal{A}$ may need to be converted to type\n",
    "$\\mathcal{B}$ to be treated as values of $\\mathcal{B}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ be two types within a type system. We define\n",
    "a coercive conversion process as a function $f$ that maps values from\n",
    "$\\mathcal{A}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f: \\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{B}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function $f$ takes a value $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{A}}$ of type\n",
    "$\\mathcal{A}$ and converts it into a value $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{B}}$ of type\n",
    "$\\mathcal{B}$, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\forall \\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{A}} \\in \\mathcal{A}, \\exists \\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{B}} \\in \\mathcal{B} : \\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{B}} = f(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{A}})\n",

    "\n",
    "A common example is numeric types, like integers and floating-point numbers. In\n",
    "many languages, an integer can be used where a floating-point number is\n",
    "expected. The integer (type `A`) is automatically converted (coerced) into a\n",
    "floating-point number (type `B`). For instance, in a language like Python, if\n",
    "you have a function that expects a float but you pass an integer, the integer\n",
    "will be automatically converted to a float.\n",

    "```\n",

    "In this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $\\mathcal{A}$ corresponds to the type `int`.\n",
    "-   $\\mathcal{B}$ corresponds to the type `float`.\n",
    "-   The function $f$ represents the implicit conversion process that Python\n",
    "    performs to convert `int` to `float` before performing the addition.\n",

    "So, when `int_value` (of type `int`, or $\\mathcal{A}$) and `float_value` (of\n",
    "type `float`, or $\\mathcal{B}$) are added, Python implicitly applies the\n",
    "conversion function $f$ to `int_value` to convert it into a `float` (type\n",
    "$\\mathcal{B}$) before the addition. This can be thought of as:\n",
    "\n",

    "-   $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{B}} = f(\\text{int_value}) = \\text{float_value}$\n",
