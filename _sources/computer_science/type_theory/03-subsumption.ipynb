    "\n",
    "```{prf:criterion} Subtype Criterion\n",
    ":label: type-theory-subtype-criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\\mathcal{T}_2$ represent two types in a type system. We\n",
    "say that $\\mathcal{T}_2$ is a subtype of $\\mathcal{T}_1$ (denoted as\n",
    "$\\mathcal{T}_2 <: \\mathcal{T}_1$) if and only if the following criteria are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Value Inclusion (Set Membership)**:\n",
    "   Every value of the subtype is also a value of the supertype, formally\n",
    "   expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\forall v \\in \\mathcal{T}_2, v \\in \\mathcal{T}_1\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    This criterion ensures that instances of the subtype can be used in any\n",
    "    context where instances of the supertype are expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Applicability (Behavioral Compatibility and Preservation of\n",
    "   Semantics)**:\n",
    "   This criterion ensures that not only are the operations or functions\n",
    "   applicable to both the supertype and the subtype, but they also preserve\n",
    "   their semantics and invariants across these types. This can be formally\n",
    "   expressed in two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Applicability**: Every function or operation applicable to instances of\n",
    "      the supertype must also be applicable to instances of the subtype.\n",
    "      Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "        \\forall f, \\left( f: \\mathcal{T}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y} \\right) \\Rightarrow \\left( f: \\mathcal{T}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y} \\right)\n",
    "        $$\n",

    "        where $f$ is a function from type $\\mathcal{T}_1$ (or $\\mathcal{T}_2$)\n",
    "        to some type $\\mathcal{Y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Semantic Preservation**: The behavior and semantics of the functions or\n",
    "      operations must be consistent when applied to either the subtype or the\n",
    "      supertype. This includes maintaining the expected results, side effects,\n",
    "      and invariants. Formally, for every function $f$ and for all values\n",
    "      $v_1 \\in \\mathcal{T}_1$ and $v_2 \\in \\mathcal{T}_2$, if $v_1$ and $v_2$\n",
    "      are considered equivalent in the context of $f$, then $f(v_1)$ and\n",
    "      $f(v_2)$ must yield equivalent results. This can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "        \\forall f, \\forall v_1 \\in \\mathcal{T}_1, \\forall v_2 \\in \\mathcal{T}_2, \\left( v_1 \\sim v_2 \\right) \\Rightarrow \\left( f(v_1) \\sim f(v_2) \\right)\n",

    "        of $f$.\n",

    "3. **Property Preservation (Invariant Maintenance)**:\n",
    "   All invariants or properties that are true for the supertype must also be\n",
    "   true for the subtype. This can be formally represented using predicate logic:\n",

    "\n",
    "    For instance, if $\\mathcal{T}_1$ has a property P, then $\\mathcal{T}_2$ should\n",
    "    also exhibit property P.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A simpler way to understand **function applicability**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a function $f$, if $f$ is applicable to $\\mathcal{T}_1$, then it should\n",
    "also be applicable to $\\mathcal{T}_2$.\n",

    "have these $N$ functionalities (methods), $f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_N$ or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to Liskov Substitution Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "The subsumption criterion is closely related to the Liskov Substitution\n",
    "Principle (LSP). The LSP emphasizes that a subtype should not only fulfill the\n",
    "structural requirements of its supertype but also adhere to its behavioral\n",
    "expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSP, by requiring that objects of a superclass be replaceable with objects\n",
    "of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program, inherently\n",
    "sets the stage for the behavioral compatibility and preservation of semantics\n",
    "criterion in the subsumption criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflexivity, Transivity and Antisymmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "A subtype relation is transitive, reflexive and obeys antisymmetry. These are\n",
    "fundamental properties of the subtype relationship in type theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reflexive**: This means every type is a subtype of itself. Formally, for\n",
    "   any type $T$, $T <: T$. This reflexivity indicates that you can always use a\n",
    "   type in the same context as itself, which is a basic and necessary property\n",
    "   for any type system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transitive**: This property means that if type $S$ is a subtype of type\n",
    "   $T$, and type $T$ is a subtype of type $U$, then type $S$ is also a subtype\n",
    "   of type $U$. In formal notation, if $S <: T$ and $T <: U$, then $S <: U$. The\n",
    "   transitive property is crucial for maintaining consistent type relationships\n",
    "   across a hierarchy or chain of types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Antisymmetry**: This property states that if type $S$ is a subtype of type\n",
    "   $T$, and type $T$ is a subtype of type $S$, then $S$ and $T$ are the same\n",
    "   type. In formal notation, if $S <: T$ and $T <: S$, then $S = T$.\n",
    "   Antisymmetry ensures that the subtype relationship helps define a clear\n",
    "   hierarchy or ordering of types, preventing circular relationships where two\n",
    "   distinct types are each other's subtypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Narrowing Values, Widening Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the subtype process, the set of values of $S$ is a subset (or equal to) of\n",
    "$T$, and the set of functions applicable to $S$ is a superset (or equal to) of\n",
    "those applicable to $T$. Stated in points for clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The set of values for which $S$ can take becomes smaller in the process of\n",
    "    subtyping;\n",
    "-   The set of functions which is applicable to $S$ becomes larger in the\n",
    "    process of subtyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integers as a Subtype of Real Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the real number system $\\mathbb{R}$, then we say that the integers\n",
    "(whole numbers) $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a **_subtype_** of $\\mathbb{R}$ because it\n",
    "fulfills the criteria for subsumption {prf:ref}`type-theory-subtype-criterion`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By demonstrating that integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ meet all three criteria under the\n",
    "subtype definition, we can formally argue that $\\mathbb{Z}$ is indeed a subtype\n",
    "of $\\mathbb{R}$. The fact that integers can have additional operations that are\n",
    "not defined for all real numbers (like the bitshift operation) does not violate\n",
    "any of the subtype criteria; it simply means that the subtype $\\mathbb{Z}$ has\n",
    "more operations than its supertype $\\mathbb{R}$, which is permissible in\n",
    "subtyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fulfilling the Subtype Criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Value Inclusion (Set Membership)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Every integer is also a real number by definition, since the set of\n",
    "      integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is included within the set of real numbers\n",
    "      $\\mathbb{R}$. This satisfies the value inclusion criterion:\n",
    "      $$\\forall v \\in \\mathbb{Z}, v \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Applicability (Behavioral Compatibility and Preservation of\n",
    "   Semantics)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - All basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication,\n",
    "      division) that are defined for real numbers are also defined for integers.\n",
    "      This satisfies the applicability part of the function applicability\n",
    "      criterion:\n",
    "\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "        \\forall f, \\left( f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y} \\right) \\Rightarrow \\left( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y} \\right)\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The results of these operations when applied to integers, as a subset of\n",
    "      real numbers, yield outcomes that are consistent with their application to\n",
    "      real numbers (with the understanding that division by an integer may need\n",
    "      to be treated with care, as it can result in a real number that is not an\n",
    "      integer). This satisfies the semantic preservation part:\n",
    "\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "        \\forall f, \\forall v_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\forall v_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\left( v_1 \\sim v_2 \\right) \\Rightarrow \\left( f(v_1) \\sim f(v_2) \\right)\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "\n",
    "        Here $\\sim$ can be interpreted as numerical equality when $v_2$ is\n",
    "        treated as a real number.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Property Preservation (Invariant Maintenance)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Invariants that hold for real numbers, such as associative and commutative\n",
    "      properties of addition and multiplication, also hold for integers. This\n",
    "      satisfies the property preservation criterion:\n",
    "\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "        \\forall P, \\left( P(\\mathbb{R}) \\right) \\Rightarrow \\left( P(\\mathbb{Z}) \\right)\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Satisfies Narrowing Values, Widening Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, if we consider the integer number system as a subtype of the real number\n",
    "system, then the set of integers values is indeed a subset of real numbers\n",
    "(narrowing values), and the set of operations/functions applicable by the set of\n",
