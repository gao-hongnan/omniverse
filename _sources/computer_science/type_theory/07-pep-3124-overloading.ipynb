    "## Function Overloading and Single/Dynamic Dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "Both concepts are quite similar, but they are different in the sense that\n",
    "function overloading is a compile-time polymorphism feature available in\n",
    "statically typed languages like Java or C++, while single dispatch is a runtime\n",
    "polymorphism mechanism typically found in dynamically typed languages like\n",
    "Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Function or method overloading is a compile-time polymorphism feature available\n",
    "in statically typed languages like Java or C++. It allows multiple functions or\n",
    "methods to be defined with the same name but different signatures (i.e.,\n",
    "different parameter types, numbers, or both). The correct function or method\n",
    "version is determined at compile time based on the argument types provided in\n",
    "the call. This decision is made based on the static types of the arguments, and\n",
    "it enables a form of polymorphism where a single function or method name can\n",
    "encompass multiple behaviors, depending on the compile-time types of the\n",
    "arguments it is invoked with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "Single dispatch is a runtime polymorphism mechanism typically found in\n",
    "dynamically typed languages like Python. It focuses on the type of the object\n",
    "that a method is invoked upon (i.e., the method's first argument, usually\n",
    "referred to as `self` in object-oriented languages). In single dispatch, the\n",
    "method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the type of the first\n",
    "argument. This allows different methods to be executed for objects of different\n",
    "types, even if those methods share the same name. Single dispatch enables\n",
    "polymorphism by allowing a single method call to exhibit various behaviors\n",
    "depending on the runtime type of the object it is called on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Runtime Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Overloaded functions in Python should be structured with multiple overload\n",
    "variants leading up to a single implementing function. These elements need to be\n",
    "placed consecutively, essentially forming a single cohesive unit in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the overload variants, only empty bodies are permitted, marked\n",
    "conventionally by the ellipsis (`...`) rather than actual code. This is because,\n",
    "during runtime, Python ignores these variants and only the final, implementing\n",
    "function is executed. Essentially, despite the presence of overload\n",
    "declarations, an overloaded function operates just like any standard Python\n",
    "function. This means there's no built-in mechanism to automatically choose\n",
    "between variants based on input types; such logic (e.g., using `if` statements\n",
    "and `isinstance` checks) needs to be manually coded into the implementing\n",
    "function[^2].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overloading with Container\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take a look into Pythons `builtins.pyi` file, you will see that the\n",
    "majority of the built-in types have overloads. Here we pick a simple use case in\n",
    "the context of a list (full type definition can be found in the file\n",
    "[`builtins.pyi`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/3c08a976564daf4d6f54fbee2fba20ec1d99dbef/stdlib/builtins.pyi#L972)):"
