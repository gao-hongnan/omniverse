### Autoregressive Self-Supervised Learning Paradigm

Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the true but unknown distribution of the natural language
space. In the context of unsupervised learning with self-supervision, such as
language modeling, we consider both the inputs and the implicit labels derived
from the same data sequence. Thus, while traditionally we might decompose the
distribution $\mathcal{D}$ of a supervised learning task into input space
$\mathcal{X}$ and label space $\mathcal{Y}$, in this scenario, $\mathcal{X}$ and
$\mathcal{Y}$ are intrinsically linked, because $\mathcal{Y}$ is a shifted
version of $\mathcal{X}$, and so we can consider $\mathcal{D}$ as a distribution
over $\mathcal{X}$ only.

Since $\mathcal{D}$ is a distribution, we also define it as a probability
distribution over $\mathcal{X}$, and we can write it as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{D} &= \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{X} ; \boldsymbol{\Theta}) \\
            &= \mathbb{P}_{\{\mathcal{X} ; \boldsymbol{\Theta}\}}(\mathbf{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$ is the parameter space that defines the distribution
$\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{X} ; \boldsymbol{\Theta})$ and $\mathbf{x}$ is a sample
from $\mathcal{X}$ generated by the distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is common to
treat $\mathbf{x}$ as a sequence of tokens (i.e. a sentence is a sequence of
tokens), and we can write $\mathbf{x} = \left(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T\right)$,
where $T$ is the length of the sequence.

Given such a sequence $\mathbf{x}$, the joint probability of the sequence can be
factorized into the product of the conditional probabilities of each token in
the sequence via the
[chain rule of probability](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule_(probability)>):

$$
\mathbb{P}(\mathbf{x} ; \boldsymbol{\Theta}) = \prod_{t=1}^T \mathbb{P}(x_t \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{t-1} ; \boldsymbol{\Theta})
$$

We can do this because natural language are _inherently ordered_. Such
decomposition allows for _tractable sampling_ from and _estimation_ of the
distribution $\mathbb{P}(\mathbf{x} ; \boldsymbol{\Theta})$ as well as any
conditionals in the form of
$\mathbb{P}(x_{t-k}, x_{t-k+1}, \ldots, x_{t} \mid x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{t-k-1} ; \boldsymbol{\Theta})$
{cite}`radford2019language`.

To this end, consider a corpus $\mathcal{S}$ with $N$ sequences
$\left\{\mathbf{x}_{1}, \mathbf{x}_{2}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_{N}\right\}$,

$$
\mathcal{S} = \left\{\mathbf{x}_{1}, \mathbf{x}_{2}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_{N}\right\} \underset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal{D}
$$

where each sequence $\mathbf{x}_{n}$ is a sequence of tokens that are sampled
$\text{i.i.d.}$ from the distribution $\mathcal{D}$.

Then, we can frame the
[likelihood function](https://gao-hongnan.github.io/gaohn-galaxy/probability_theory/08_estimation_theory/maximum_likelihood_estimation/concept.html)
$\hat{\mathcal{L}}(\cdot)$ as the likelihood of observing the sequences in the
corpus $\mathcal{S}$,

$$
\hat{\mathcal{L}}\left(\mathcal{S} ; \hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}}\right) = \prod_{n=1}^N \mathbb{P}(\mathbf{x}_{n} ; \hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}})
$$

where $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}}$ is the estimated parameter space that
approximates the true parameter space $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$.

Subsequently, the objective function is now well-defined, to be the maximization
of the likelihood of the sequences in the corpus $\mathcal{S}$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{*} &= \underset{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \in \boldsymbol{\Theta}}{\text{argmax}} \hat{\mathcal{L}}\left(\mathcal{S} ; \hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}}\right) \\
                              &= \underset{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \in \boldsymbol{\Theta}}{\text{argmax}} \prod_{n=1}^N \mathbb{P}(\mathbf{x}_{n} ; \hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}}) \\
                              &= \underset{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \in \boldsymbol{\Theta}}{\text{argmax}} \prod_{n=1}^N \prod_{t=1}^{T_n} \mathbb{P}(x_{n, t} \mid x_{n, 1}, x_{n, 2}, \ldots, x_{n, t-1} ; \hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}}) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

where $T_n$ is the length of the sequence $\mathbf{x}_{n}$.

Owing to the fact that multiplying many probabilities together can lead to
[numerical instability](https://d2l.ai/chapter_appendix-mathematics-for-deep-learning/maximum-likelihood.html#numerical-optimization-and-the-negative-log-likelihood)
because the product of many probabilities can be very small, it is common and
necessary to use the log-likelihood as the objective function, because it can be
proven that maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the
likelihood itself.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{*} &= \underset{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \in \boldsymbol{\Theta}}{\text{argmax}} \log\left(\hat{\mathcal{L}}\left(\mathcal{S} ; \hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}}\right)\right) \\
&= \underset{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \in \boldsymbol{\Theta}}{\text{argmax}} \sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^{T_n} \log \mathbb{P}(x_{n, t} \mid x_{n, 1}, x_{n, 2}, \ldots, x_{n, t-1} ; \hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}}) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Furthermore, since we are treating the the loss function as a form of
minimization, we can simply negate the log-likelihood to obtain the negative
log-likelihood as the objective function to be minimized,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{*} &= \underset{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \in \boldsymbol{\Theta}}{\text{argmin}} \left(-\log\left(\hat{\mathcal{L}}\left(\mathcal{S} ; \hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}}\right)\right)\right) \\
&= \underset{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \in \boldsymbol{\Theta}}{\text{argmin}} \left(-\sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^{T_n} \log \mathbb{P}(x_{n, t} \mid x_{n, 1}, x_{n, 2}, \ldots, x_{n, t-1} ; \hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}})\right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

It is worth noting that the objective function is a function of the parameter
space $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}}$, and not the data $\mathcal{S}$, so all
analysis such as convergence and consistency will be with respect to the
parameter space $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}}$.

To this end, we denote the GPT model $\mathcal{G}$ to be an _autoregressive_ and
_self-supervised learning_ model that is trained to maximize the likelihood of
observing all data points $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{S}$ via the objective
function $\hat{\mathcal{L}}\left(\mathcal{S} ; \hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}}\right)$
by learning the conditional probability distribution
$\mathbb{P}(x_t \mid x_{<t} ; \hat{\boldsymbol{\Theta}})$ over the vocabulary
$\mathcal{V}$ of tokens, conditioned on the contextual preciding tokens
$x_{<t} = \left(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{t-1}\right)$. We are clear that although
the goal is to model the joint probability distribution of the token sequences,
we can do so by estimating the joint probability distribution via the
conditional probability distributions.

### Corpus and Tokenization

```{admonition} Step 1. Corpus
:class: note

Consider a corpus $\mathcal{S}$ consisting of $N$ sequences, denoted as
${\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N}$, where each sequence
$\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T) \in \mathcal{S}$ is a sequence of $T$
tokens. These tokens are sampled i.i.d. from a true, unknown distribution
$\mathcal{D}$:

$$
\mathcal{S}=\left\{\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N\right\} \underset{\text { i.i.d. }}{\sim} \mathcal{D}
$$

Each sequence $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{S}$ represents a collection of tokenized
elements (e.g., words or characters), where each token $x_t$ comes from a finite
vocabulary $\mathcal{V}$.
```

```{admonition} Step 2. Vocabulary and Tokenization
:class: note

Let $\mathcal{V} = \{w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_V\}$ be the vocabulary set, where $w_j$
is the $j$-th token in the vocabulary and $V = |\mathcal{V}|$ is the size of the
vocabulary. It is worth noting that it is common to train one's own vocabulary
and tokenizer on the corpus $\mathcal{S}$, but for simplicity, we assume that
the vocabulary set $\mathcal{V}$ is predefined.

Let $\mathcal{X}$ be the set of all possible sequences that can be formed by
concatenating tokens from the vocabulary set $\mathcal{V}$. Each sequence
$\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$ is a finite sequence of tokens, and the length of
each sequence is denoted by $\tau$. Formally:

$$
\mathcal{X} = \bigcup_{\tau=1}^{T} \mathcal{V}^{\tau}
$$

where $\mathcal{V}^\tau$ represents the set of all sequences of length $\tau$
formed by concatenating tokens from $\mathcal{V}$, and $T$ is the maximum
sequence length.

Now, let
$\mathcal{S} = \{\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N\} \subset \mathcal{X}$
be a corpus of $N$ sequences, where each sequence $\mathbf{x}_n \in \mathcal{X}$
is a finite sequence of tokens from the vocabulary set $\mathcal{V}$.

The tokenizer algorithm $\mathcal{T}$ is a function that operates on individual
sequences $\mathbf{x}_n$ from the corpus $\mathcal{S}$ and maps the tokens to
their corresponding integer indices using the vocabulary set $\mathcal{V}$:

$$
\mathcal{T}: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}^{\leq T}
$$

where $\mathbb{N}^{\leq T}$ represents the set of all finite sequences of
natural numbers (non-negative integers) with lengths up to $T$. The output of
$\mathcal{T}$ is a tokenized sequence, which is a finite sequence of integer
indices corresponding to the tokens in the input sequence.

To map the tokens to their corresponding integer indices, we define a bijective
mapping function $f: \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \{1, 2, \ldots, V\}$ such that:

$$
f(w_j) = j, \quad \forall j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, V\}
$$

where $f(w_j)$ represents the integer index assigned to the token
$w_j \in \mathcal{V}$.

Given a sequence $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\tau) \in \mathcal{X}$,
where $\tau \leq T$ is the length of the sequence, the tokenizer algorithm
$\mathcal{T}$ maps each token $x_t$ to its corresponding integer index using the
bijective mapping function $f$. The tokenized representation of the sequence
$\mathbf{x}$ can be defined as:

$$
\mathcal{T}(\mathbf{x}) = \left(f(x_1), f(x_2), \ldots, f(x_\tau)\right)
$$

where $f(x_t)$ is the integer index assigned to the token $x_t$ based on $f$.

In the case where a token $x_t$ is not present in the vocabulary set
$\mathcal{V}$, a special token index, such as $f(\text{<UNK>})$, can be assigned
to represent an unknown token.

The tokenizer algorithm $\mathcal{T}$ can be applied to each sequence
$\mathbf{x}_n$ in the corpus $\mathcal{S}$ to obtain the tokenized corpus
$\mathcal{S}^{\mathcal{T}}$:

$$
\mathcal{S}^{\mathcal{T}} = \left\{\mathcal{T}(\mathbf{x}_1), \mathcal{T}(\mathbf{x}_2), \ldots, \mathcal{T}(\mathbf{x}_N)\right\} \subset \mathbb{N}^{\leq T}
$$

where $\mathcal{T}(\mathbf{x}_n)$ is the tokenized representation of the
sequence $\mathbf{x}_n \in \mathcal{S}$.

The tokenized corpus $\mathcal{S}^{\mathcal{T}}$ is a set of sequences, where
each sequence is a finite sequence of integer indices representing the tokens in
the original sequences from the corpus $\mathcal{S}$.
```

### Token Embedding and Positional Encoding

```{admonition} Step 3. One Hot Encoding
:class: note

For each sequence $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{S}^{\mathcal{T}}$ in the corpus, we
would apply one hot encoding so that each sample/sequence is transformed to
$\mathbf{X}^{\text{ohe}} \in \{0, 1\}^{T \times V}$ where $V$ is the vocabulary
size and $T$ the pre-defined context window size.

$$
\mathbf{X}^{\text{ohe}} = \begin{bmatrix}
o_{1,1} & o_{1,2} & \cdots & o_{1,V} \\
o_{2,1} & o_{2,2} & \cdots & o_{2,V} \\
\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
o_{T,1} & o_{T,2} & \cdots & o_{T,V}
\end{bmatrix} \in \{0, 1\}^{T \times V}
$$

Each row $\mathbf{X}^{\text{ohe}}_{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times V}$ represents
the one-hot encoded representation of the token at position $t$ in the sequence.
```

```{admonition} Step 4. Token Embedding
:class: note

Given the one-hot encoded input
$\mathbf{X}^{\text{ohe}} \in \{0, 1\}^{T \times |\mathcal{V}|}$, where $T$ is
the sequence length and $V = |\mathcal{V}|$ is the vocabulary size, we obtain
the token embedding matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times D}$ by matrix
multiplying $\mathbf{X}^{\text{ohe}}$ with the token embedding weight matrix
$\mathbf{W}_e \in \mathbb{R}^{V \times D}$, where $D$ is the embedding
dimension:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{X} &= \mathbf{X}^{\text{ohe}} \operatorname{@} \mathbf{W}_{e} \\
T \times D                      &\leftarrow T \times V \operatorname{@} V \times D  \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D   &\leftarrow\mathcal{B} \times T \times V \operatorname{@} V \times D
\end{aligned}
$$
```

```{admonition} Weight Sharing
:class: tip

Note carefully that with the addition of batch dimension $\mathcal{B}$ the
matrix multiplication is still well-defined for such tensor in PyTorch because
we are essentially just performing matrix multiplication in $T \times D$ for
each sequence $\mathbf{X}_b \in \mathbf{X}^{\mathcal{B}}$ with the same weight
matrix $\mathbf{W}_{e}$.

The token embedding weight matrix $\mathbf{W}_e$ with dimensions $V \times D$ is
shared across all sequences in the batch. Each sequence $\mathbf{X}^{(b)}$ in the
batched input tensor $\mathbf{X}^{\mathcal{B}}$ undergoes the same matrix
multiplication with $\mathbf{W}_e$ to obtain the corresponding embedded sequence
representation.

The idea of weight sharing is that the same set of parameters (in this case, the
embedding weights) is used for processing multiple instances of the input
(sequences in the batch). Instead of having separate embedding weights for each
sequence, the same embedding matrix is applied to all sequences. This parameter
sharing allows the model to learn a common representation for the tokens across
different sequences.
```

```{admonition} Step 5. Positional Embedding
:class: note

In addition to the token embeddings, we incorporate positional information into
the input representation to capture the sequential nature of the input
sequences. Let $\operatorname{PE}(\cdot)$ denote the positional encoding
function that maps the token positions to their corresponding positional
embeddings.

Given the token embedding matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times D}$, where
$T$ is the sequence length and $D$ is the embedding dimension, we add the
positional embeddings to obtain the position-aware input representation
$\tilde{\mathbf{X}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times D}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{\mathbf{X}} &= \operatorname{PE}(\mathbf{X}) + \mathbf{X} \\
T \times D                      &\leftarrow T \times D \operatorname{+} T \times D  \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D   &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D \operatorname{+} \mathcal{B} \times T \times D
\end{aligned}
$$

The positional encoding function $\operatorname{PE}(\cdot)$ can be implemented
in various ways, such as using fixed sinusoidal functions or learned positional
embeddings. For the latter, we can easily replace $\operatorname{PE}(\cdot)$
with a learnable positional embedding layer in the model architecture
($\mathbf{W}_{p}$).
```

```{admonition} Dropout And Elementwise Operation
:class: tip

At this stage, it is common practice to apply a dropout layer
$\operatorname{Dropout}(\cdot)$ to the position-aware input representation
$\tilde{\mathbf{X}}$ (or $\tilde{\mathbf{X}}_{\text{batch}}$ in the case of a
batch). Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of
the elements in the input tensor to zero during training and is an
**_element-wise_** operation that acts **_independently_** on each element in
the tensor. This means that each element has a fixed probability (usually
denoted as $p$) of being set to zero, regardless of its position or the values
of other elements in the tensor.

Mathematically, for an input tensor $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times D}$,
elementwise dropout can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{X}^{\text{dropout}} &= \mathbf{X} \odot \mathbf{M} \\
T \times D &= T \times D \odot T \times D
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\odot$ denotes the elementwise (Hadamard) product, and
$\mathbf{M} \in \{0, 1\}^{T \times D}$ is a binary mask tensor of the same shape
as $\mathbf{X}$. Each element in $\mathbf{M}$ is independently sampled from a
Bernoulli distribution with probability $p$ of being 0 (i.e., dropped) and
probability $1-p$ of being 1 (i.e., retained).
```

### Backbone Architecture

````{admonition} Step 6. Pre-Layer Normalization For Masked Multi-Head Attention
:class: note

Before passing the input through the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) layer, we apply
Layer Normalization to the positionally encoded embeddings $\tilde{\mathbf{X}}$.
This is known as pre-layer Normalization in the more modern GPT architecture (as
opposed to post-layer Normalization, which is applied after the MHA layer).

The Layer Normalization function $\operatorname{LayerNorm}(\cdot)$ is a
**_vectorwise_** operation that operates on the feature dimension $D$ of the
input tensor. It normalizes the activations to have zero mean and unit variance
across the features for each token independently. The vectorwise nature of Layer
Normalization arises from the fact that it computes the mean and standard
deviation along the feature dimension, requiring **aggregation** of information
across the entire feature vector for each token.

Mathematically, for an input tensor $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times D}$,
Layer Normalization is applied independently to each row
$\mathbf{x}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times D}$, where $t \in \{1, 2, \ldots, T\}$.
The normalization is performed using the following formula:

$$
\operatorname{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{x}_t) = \frac{\mathbf{x}_t - \mu_t}{\sqrt{\sigma_t^2 + \epsilon}} \odot \gamma + \beta
$$

where $\mu_t \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\sigma_t^2 \in \mathbb{R}$ are the mean and
variance of the features in $\mathbf{x}_t$ (broadcasted), respectively,
$\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability,
$\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^D$ and $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^D$ are learnable affine
parameters (scale and shift), and $\odot$ denotes the elementwise product.

Applying Layer Normalization to the positionally encoded embeddings
$\tilde{\mathbf{X}}$ at layer $\ell$ results in the normalized embeddings
$\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1 &= \operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\tilde{\mathbf{X}}\right) \\
T \times D &\leftarrow T \times D \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1$ represents the normalized embeddings at layer
$\ell$, and the index $1$ refers to the first sub-layer/sub-step in the decoder
block.

For the first layer ($\ell = 1$), $\tilde{\mathbf{X}}$ is the output from Step 4
(Positional Embedding). So we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_1 &= \operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\tilde{\mathbf{X}}\right) \\
T \times D &\leftarrow T \times D \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D
\end{aligned}
$$

In code we have:

```python
def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    mean = x.mean(dim=-1, keepdim=True)  # [1]
    std = x.std(dim=-1, keepdim=True, unbiased=False)  # [2]
    if self.elementwise_affine:
        return self.gamma * (x - mean) / (std + self.eps) + self.beta  # [3]
    return (x - mean) / (std + self.eps)  # [4]
```

```{admonition} Step 7. Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention
:class: note

Given the normalized input embeddings
$\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}$ from Step
6 (Pre-Layer Normalization), we apply the masked multi-head self-attention
mechanism to compute the output embeddings $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2$, where the
index $2$ denotes the second sub-layer within the $\ell$-th decoder layer
(multi-head attention).

Let $\operatorname{MaskedMultiHead}^{(\ell)}(\cdot)$ denote the masked
multi-head self-attention function at layer $\ell$. The masked multi-head
self-attention operation takes the normalized input embeddings
$\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1$ as the query, key, and value matrices, and produces the
output embeddings $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2$.

For the first layer ($\ell = 1$), the masked multi-head self-attention operation
can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_2 &= \operatorname{MaskedMultiHead}^{(1)}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_1, \mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_1, \mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_1\right) \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \operatorname{MaskedMultiHead}^{(1)}\left(\mathcal{B} \times T \times D, \mathcal{B} \times T \times D, \mathcal{B} \times T \times D\right) \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}$
represents the output embeddings of the masked multi-head self-attention
operation at layer $1$, and
$\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}$ represents
the normalized input embeddings from Step 6.

The $\operatorname{MaskedMultiHead}^{(\ell)}(\cdot)$ function internally
performs the following steps:

1. Linearly projects the input embeddings $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1$ into query,
   key, and value matrices for each attention head.
2. Computes the scaled dot-product attention scores between the query and key
   matrices, and applies the attention mask to prevent attending to future
   tokens.
3. Applies the softmax function to the masked attention scores to obtain the
   attention weights.
4. Multiplies the attention weights with the value matrices to produce the
   output embeddings for each attention head.
5. Concatenates the output embeddings from all attention heads and linearly
   projects them to obtain the final output embeddings $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2$.

The specifics of the scaled dot-product attention mechanism and the multi-head
attention operation will be discussed in the next few steps.
```

````{admonition} Step 7.1. Linear Projections, Query, Key, and Value Matrices
:class: note

In the masked multi-head self-attention mechanism, the first step is to linearly
project the normalized input embeddings $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1$ into query, key,
and value matrices for each attention head. This step is performed using
learnable weight matrices $\mathbf{W}^{Q, (\ell)}$, $\mathbf{W}^{K, (\ell)}$,
and $\mathbf{W}^{V, (\ell)}$.

Mathematically, the linear projections can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Q}^{(\ell)} &= \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1 \mathbf{W}^{Q, (\ell)} ,\quad \mathcal{B} \times T \times D \leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D \times D \\
\mathbf{K}^{(\ell)} &= \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1 \mathbf{W}^{K, (\ell)} ,\quad \mathcal{B} \times T \times D \leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D \times D \\
\mathbf{V}^{(\ell)} &= \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1 \mathbf{W}^{V, (\ell)} ,\quad \mathcal{B} \times T \times D \leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D \times D
\end{aligned}
$$

where:

-   $\mathbf{Q}^{(\ell)} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}$ is the
    query matrix for the $\ell$-th decoder layer.
-   $\mathbf{K}^{(\ell)} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}$ is the
    key matrix for the $\ell$-th decoder layer.
-   $\mathbf{V}^{(\ell)} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}$ is the
    value matrix for the $\ell$-th decoder layer.
-   $\mathbf{W}^{Q, (\ell)} \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D}$,
    $\mathbf{W}^{K, (\ell)} \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D}$, and
    $\mathbf{W}^{V, (\ell)} \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D}$ are the learnable
    weight matrices that transform the normalized embeddings into queries, keys,
    and values, respectively.
-   Again notice that we are using the same weight matrices for all heads,
    weight/parameters sharing.

The linear projections are performed using matrix multiplication between the
normalized input embeddings $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1$ and the corresponding weight
matrices. The resulting query, key, and value matrices have the same shape as
the input embeddings: $\mathcal{B} \times T \times D$.

In the provided code snippet, the linear projections are implemented using the
`torch.nn.Linear` modules `self.W_Q`, `self.W_K`, and `self.W_V`:

```python
Q: torch.Tensor = self.W_Q(z).contiguous()  # Z @ W_Q = [B, T, D] @ [D, D] = [B, T, D]
K: torch.Tensor = self.W_K(z).contiguous()  # Z @ W_K = [B, T, D] @ [D, D] = [B, T, D]
V: torch.Tensor = self.W_V(z).contiguous()  # Z @ W_V = [B, T, D] @ [D, D] = [B, T, D]
```

````{admonition} Step 7.2. Reshaping and Transposing Query, Key, and Value Matrices
:class: note

Subsequently, we have already known that instead of for loop to compute each
head, we can compute all heads in parallel using matrix operations. The query,
key, and value matrices are split into $H$ heads, and the attention scores are
computed in parallel. So our aim is simple, we want to reshape the query, key,
and value matrices to include the head dimension, basically splitting the $D$
dimension into $H$ heads. We can denote the reshaping and transposition
operation using tensor index notation which makes it explicit how indices are
permuted and combined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Q}_{b,t,d} & \rightarrow \mathbf{Q}_{b,t,h,d_q} \quad \text{where } d = h \cdot (D // H) + d_q, \text{ for } h \in [0, H-1] \text{ and } d_q \in [0, D//H-1] \\
\mathbf{Q}_{b,t,h,d_q} & \rightarrow \mathbf{Q}_{b,h,t,d_q} \quad \text{(transpose dimensions)}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{K}_{b,t,d} & \rightarrow \mathbf{K}_{b,t,h,d_k} \quad \text{where } d = h \cdot (D // H) + d_k, \text{ for } h \in [0, H-1] \text{ and } d_k \in [0, D//H-1] \\
\mathbf{K}_{b,t,h,d_k} & \rightarrow \mathbf{K}_{b,h,t,d_k} \quad \text{(transpose dimensions)}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{V}_{b,t,d} & \rightarrow \mathbf{V}_{b,t,h,d_v} \quad \text{where } d = h \cdot (D // H) + d_v, \text{ for } h \in [0, H-1] \text{ and } d_v \in [0, D//H-1] \\
\mathbf{V}_{b,t,h,d_v} & \rightarrow \mathbf{V}_{b,h,t,d_v} \quad \text{(transpose dimensions)}
\end{aligned}
$$

To this end, we have reshaped and transposed the query, key, and value matrices
as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Q}^{(\ell)} &\in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D} \rightarrow \mathbf{Q}^{(\ell)}  \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times H \times D // H} \rightarrow \mathbf{Q}^{(\ell)}  \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times D // H} \\
\mathbf{K}^{(\ell)}  &\in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D} \rightarrow \mathbf{K}^{(\ell)}  \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times H \times D // H} \rightarrow \mathbf{K}^{(\ell)}  \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times D // H} \\
\mathbf{V}^{(\ell)}  &\in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D} \rightarrow \mathbf{V}^{(\ell)}  \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times H \times D // H} \rightarrow \mathbf{V}^{(\ell)}  \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times D // H}
\end{aligned}
$$

In code, the reshaping and transposition operations are performed as follows:

```python
Q = Q.view(B, T, self.H, D // self.H).transpose(dim0=1, dim1=2) # [B, T, D] -> [B, T, H, D // H] -> [B, H, T, D//H]
K = K.view(B, T, self.H, D // self.H).transpose(dim0=1, dim1=2)
V = V.view(B, T, self.H, D // self.H).transpose(dim0=1, dim1=2)
```

The `view` operation reshapes the matrices to include the head dimension, and
the `transpose` operation swaps the sequence and head dimensions to obtain the
desired ordering of dimensions.

```{admonition} Step 7.3. Scaled Dot-Product Attention and Masking
:class: note

The attention mask matrix $\mathbf{M} \in \{0, -\infty\}^{T \times T}$ is
initially constructed as a lower triangular matrix of ones and zeros:

$$
\mathbf{M} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

In this matrix, "1" (conceptually) allows attention, and "0" blocks it. This
mask is broadcastable to the attention scores tensor
$\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times T$ since this is a typical shape for
multi-head self-attention.

However, before applying the mask, the ones in $\mathbf{M}$ are typically
replaced with zeros, and the zeros are replaced with a large negative value
(e.g., $-\infty$) to effectively set the attention weights of the masked
positions to zero after the softmax operation (which is to mimic the
`masked_fill` operation in the code). So, the actual mask matrix used in the
attention mechanism looks like this:

$$
\mathbf{M}_{ij} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
0 & \text{if } i \geq j \\
-\infty & \text{if } i < j
\end{array} \right\} \quad \text{forms a triangular matrix:} \quad \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -\infty & -\infty & \cdots & -\infty \\
0 & 0 & -\infty & \cdots & -\infty \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & -\infty \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The masking operation will then be applied elementwise to the attention scores
tensor $\mathbf{A}_{s}^{(\ell)}$, which is first obtained by computing the
scaled dot product between the query matrix $\mathbf{Q}^{(\ell)}$ and the key
matrix $\mathbf{K}^{(\ell)}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{A}_{s}^{(\ell)} &= \frac{\mathbf{Q}^{(\ell)} (\mathbf{K}^{(\ell)})^T}{\sqrt{D//H}} \\
\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times T &\leftarrow \frac{\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times D//H \operatorname{@} \mathcal{B} \times H \times D//H \times T}{\sqrt{D//H}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The masking operation is performed using the elementwise sum ($\oplus$) between
the attention scores tensor
$\mathbf{A}_{s}^{(\ell)} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times T}$
and the **_broadcasted_** mask matrix
$\mathbf{M} \in \{0, -\infty\}^{\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times T}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{A}_{s}^{M, (\ell)} &= \mathbf{A}_{s}^{(\ell)} \oplus \mathbf{M} \\
\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times T &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times T \oplus \mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times T
\end{aligned}
$$

The elementwise sum ensures that the attention scores corresponding to future
tokens (positions above the diagonal) are added by $-\infty$ to effectively
block attention to those positions and added by $0$ for the rest of the
positions that are allowed to attend to.

Finally, the masked attention scores $\mathbf{A}_{s}^{M, (\ell)}$ are passed
through the softmax function to obtain the attention weights
$\mathbf{A}_{w}^{(\ell)}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{A}_{w}^{(\ell)} &= \operatorname{softmax}\left(\mathbf{A}_{s}^{M, (\ell)}\right) \\
\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times T &\leftarrow \operatorname{softmax}\left(\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times T\right) \\
\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times T &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times T
\end{aligned}
$$

The softmax function is then applied to the masked attention scores tensor in a
**vectorwise** manner. Specifically, the softmax operation is applied
**independently** to each row of the last two dimensions ($T \times T$) for each
batch and head. This ensures that the attention weights for each token position
across the sequence length sum up to 1. The large negative values in the masked
positions ensure that the corresponding attention weights become close to zero
after the softmax operation.

Finally, the context matrix $\mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}$ is obtained by multiplying the
attention weights $\mathbf{A}_{w}^{(\ell)}$ with the value matrix
$\mathbf{V}^{(\ell)}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{C}^{(\ell)} &= \mathbf{A}_{w}^{(\ell)} \mathbf{V}^{(\ell)} \\
\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times D//H &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times T \times \mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times D//H
\end{aligned}
$$

The resulting context matrix $\mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}$ contains the attended values
for each head in layer $\ell$.

Note $\mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}$ is the context matrix which is the output of the
self-attention mechanism and it contains $\operatorname{head}_{\ell, h}^{M}$ for
each head $h$ in the layer $\ell$.
```

```python
d_q = query.size(dim=-1)

attention_scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(dim0=-2, dim1=-1)) / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(d_q).float())         # [B, H, T, d_q] @ [B, H, d_q, T] = [B, H, T, T]
attention_scores = attention_scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, float("-inf")) if mask is not None else attention_scores     # [B, H, T, T]

attention_weights = attention_scores.softmax(dim=-1)        # [B, H, T, T]
attention_weights = self.dropout(attention_weights)         # [B, H, T, T]

context_vector = torch.matmul(attention_weights, value)     # [B, H, T, T] @ [B, H, T, d_v] = [B, H, T, d_v]

````{admonition} Step 7.4. Concatenation and Projection
:class: note

Recall that the output from the masked multi-head self-attention operation,
denoted as $\mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}$, has a shape of
$\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times D//H$, where $\mathcal{B}$ is the batch
size, $H$ is the number of attention heads, $T$ is the sequence length, and
$D//H$ is the dimension of each head.

To concatenate the heads and obtain a tensor of shape
$\mathcal{B} \times T \times D$, we first need to transpose the dimensions of
$\mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}$ from $\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times D//H$ to
$\mathcal{B} \times T \times H \times D//H$ - necessary to concatenate the heads
along the last dimension (feature dimension).

Using tensor index notation or semi einsum notation, we can denote the
transposition operation as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}_{b,h,t,d} & \rightarrow \mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}_{b,t,h,d} \quad \text{(transpose dimensions)}
\end{aligned}
$$

After transposition, the heads are concatenated along the last dimension
(feature dimension) to obtain a tensor of shape $\mathcal{B} \times T \times D$.
The concatenation operation can be expressed using the direct sum notation as
follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}_{\text{concat}} &= \bigoplus_{h=0}^{H-1} \mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}_{b,t,h,:} \\
&= \mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}_{b,t,0,:} \oplus \mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}_{b,t,1,:} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}_{b,t,H-1,:} \\
&= \operatorname{head}^{\ell}_1 \oplus \operatorname{head}^{\ell}_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus \operatorname{head}^{\ell}_H \\
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}_{b,t,h,:}$ represents the tensor slice corresponding
to the $h$-th head at batch index $b$ and time step $t$, and $\oplus$ denotes
the concatenation operation along the feature dimension.

```{admonition} Direct Sum Notation Is Concatenation
:class: dropdown

In the concatenation of attention heads, the direct sum notation ($\oplus$) is
used to represent the concatenation operation, not elementwise addition. The
direct sum combines the output tensors from each attention head along a specific
dimension (usually the feature dimension). It is a vectorwise operation that
stacks the tensors along the specified dimension, creating a new tensor with an
increased dimension size.
```

The concatenation operation can be summarized as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{C}^{(\ell)} &\in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times H \times D//H} \xrightarrow{\text{concatenate}} \mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}_{\text{concat}} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}
\end{aligned}
$$

To summarize, the transposition and concatenation operations can be represented
as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{C}^{(\ell)} &\in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times H \times T \times D//H} \rightarrow \mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}  \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times H \times D//H} \rightarrow \mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}  \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, the concatenated tensor is linearly transformed using the projection
matrix $\mathbf{W}^{O, (\ell)}$ to obtain the output $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2 &= \mathbf{C}^{(\ell)}_{\text{concat}} \mathbf{W}^{O, (\ell)} \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D \operatorname{@} D \times D \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D
\end{aligned}
$$

In code, these operations can be implemented as follows:

```python
self.context_vector = self.context_vector.transpose(dim0=1, dim1=2).contiguous().view(B, T, D)  # merge all heads together

projected_context_vector: torch.Tensor = self.resid_dropout(
    self.context_projection(self.context_vector)  # [B, T, D] @ [D, D] = [B, T, D]
)
```

To this end, for layer $\ell=1$, we would have the output tensor
$\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_2$ - which becomes the input to the next sub-layer within the
same block $\ell$. Optionally, we can apply a projection dropout to the output
tensor $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2$ before passing it to the next sub-layer.
````

````{admonition} Step 8. Residual Connection
:class: note

In the Transformer/GPT architecture, residual connections are used to facilitate
the flow of information and gradients throughout the network. The residual
connection in the decoder block is added between the input to the block and the
output of the Masked Multi-Head Attention layer.

For the first decoder block ($\ell = 1$), the residual connection is added
between the positionally encoded embeddings $\tilde{\mathbf{X}}$ and the output
of the Masked Multi-Head Attention layer $\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_2$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_{3} &= \tilde{\mathbf{X}} + \text{MaskedMultiHead}^{(1)}\left(\text{LayerNorm}\left(\tilde{\mathbf{X}}\right), \text{LayerNorm}\left(\tilde{\mathbf{X}}\right), \text{LayerNorm}\left(\tilde{\mathbf{X}}\right)\right) \\
&= \tilde{\mathbf{X}} + \text{MaskedMultiHead}^{(1)}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_{1}, \mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_{1}, \mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_{1}\right) \\
&= \tilde{\mathbf{X}} + \mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_{2} \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D + \mathcal{B} \times T \times D \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_{3}$ represents the output of the residual connection
for the first decoder block, $\tilde{\mathbf{X}}$ is the positionally encoded
embeddings, and $\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_{2}$ is the output of the Masked Multi-Head
Attention layer.

For subsequent decoder blocks ($\ell > 1$), the residual connection is added
between the output of the previous decoder block
$\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell-1)}_{\text{out}}$ and the output of the Masked Multi-Head
Attention layer $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2$ of the current block:

$$
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3 = \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell-1)}_{\text{out}} + \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2
$$

where $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3$ represents the output of the residual connection
for the $\ell$-th decoder block, $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell-1)}_{\text{out}}$ is the
output of the previous decoder block after the Position-wise Feed-Forward
Network and the second residual connection, and $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2$ is the
output of the Masked Multi-Head Attention layer of the current block.

The complete set of equations for the $\ell$-th decoder block ($\ell > 1$) can
be summarized as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1 &= \text{LayerNorm}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell-1)}_{\text{out}}\right) \\
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2 &= \text{MaskedMultiHead}^{(\ell)}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1, \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1, \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1\right) \\
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3 &= \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell-1)}_{\text{out}} + \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1$ represents the output of the Layer Normalization
step, $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2$ represents the output of the Masked Multi-Head
Attention layer, and $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3$ represents the output of the
residual connection.

The residual connection allows the model to learn the identity function more
easily, enabling the flow of information and gradients across multiple layers.
By adding the input of the block to the output of the Masked Multi-Head
Attention layer, the model can choose to either learn new information from the
attention mechanism or retain the original input information if it is already
sufficient.

In code, the whole series of operation up till now is simply:

```python
z = z + self.attn(z=self.ln_1(z))
```

```{admonition} Step 9. Pre-Layer Normalization For Position-wise Feed-Forward Network
:class: note

After the masked multi-head attention block and the residual connection, the
next step is to apply the position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) to the output
of the self-attention mechanism and the residual block $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3$.
However, before applying the FFN, we perform pre-layer normalization on the
input to the FFN.

Mathematically, the pre-layer normalization step for the FFN can be expressed
as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_4 &= \operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3\right) \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\mathcal{B} \times T \times D\right) \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_4$ represents the normalized input to the FFN at
layer $\ell$, and $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3$ is the output of the residual
connection from the previous step.

As discussed in Step 6, the Layer Normalization function
$\operatorname{LayerNorm}(\cdot)$ is a vectorwise operation that operates on the
feature dimension $D$ of the input tensor. It normalizes the activations to have
zero mean and unit variance across the features for each token independently.
It's important to note that the pre-layer normalization step is applied
independently to each token
$\mathbf{Z}_{3, t}^{(\ell)} \in \mathbf{Z}_3^{(\ell)}$ in the sequence with
shape $T \times D$, where $T$ is the sequence length and $D$ is the feature
dimension, normalizing the features across the feature dimension $D$.

For the first layer ($\ell = 1$), the pre-layer normalization step can be
written as:

$$
\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_4 = \operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_3\right)
$$
```

```{admonition} Step 10. Position-wise Feed-Forward Network
:class: note

Given the normalized input $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_4$ to the Position-wise
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in layer $\ell$, the FFN applies two linear
transformations with a GELU activation function in between. The operations
within the FFN can be mathematically represented as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}^{FF, (\ell)}_1 &= \text{GELU}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_4 \mathbf{W}^{FF, (\ell)}_1 + \mathbf{b}^{FF, (\ell)}_1\right) \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times d_{\text{ff}} &\leftarrow \text{GELU}\left(\mathcal{B} \times T \times D \operatorname{@} D \times d_{\text{ff}} + d_{\text{ff}}\right) \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times d_{\text{ff}} &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times d_{\text{ff}} \\
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_5 &= \mathbf{Z}^{FF, (\ell)}_1 \mathbf{W}^{FF, (\ell)}_2 + \mathbf{b}^{FF, (\ell)}_2 \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times d_{\text{ff}} \operatorname{@} d_{\text{ff}} \times D + D \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D
\end{aligned}
$$

where:

-   $\mathbf{W}^{FF, (\ell)}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times d_{\text{ff}}}$ and
    $\mathbf{b}^{FF, (\ell)}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{ff}}}$ are the weights
    and biases of the first linear transformation, respectively.
-   $\mathbf{W}^{FF, (\ell)}_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{ff}} \times D}$ and
    $\mathbf{b}^{FF, (\ell)}_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ are the weights and biases of
    the second linear transformation, respectively.
-   $d_{\text{ff}}$ is the dimensionality of the hidden layer in the FFN, which
    is typically larger than the input dimensionality $D$.
-   $\operatorname{GELU}(\cdot)$ denotes the Gaussian Error Linear Unit
    activation function.

Note the slight abuse of notation where $\mathbf{Z}^{FF, (\ell)}_1$ is used to
denote the intermediate output of the first linear transformation in the FFN.
This should not be confused with the earlier notation $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1$.

For the first layer ($\ell = 1$), the FFN operations can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}^{FF, (1)}_1 &= \operatorname{GELU}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_4 \mathbf{W}^{FF, (1)}_1 + \mathbf{b}^{FF, (1)}_1\right) \\
\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_5 &= \mathbf{Z}^{FF, (1)}_1 \mathbf{W}^{FF, (1)}_2 + \mathbf{b}^{FF, (1)}_2
\end{aligned}
$$
```

```{admonition} Step 11. Residual Connection
:class: note

After obtaining the output $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_5$ from the Position-wise
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in layer $\ell$, the final step in the decoder block
is to apply a residual connection.

Mathematically, this step can be represented as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_{\text{out}} &= \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3 + \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_5 \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D + \mathcal{B} \times T \times D \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D
\end{aligned}
$$

where:

-   $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}$ is
    the output of the residual connection from the Masked Multi-Head Attention
    block (Step 8).
-   $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_5 \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}$ is
    the output from the FFN (Step 10).
-   $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_{\text{out}} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}$
    is the output of the decoder block at layer $\ell$ and serves as the input
    to the next decoder block ($\ell + 1$).

The residual connection is performed by adding the output of the Masked
Multi-Head Attention block $\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3\right)$ and the output
of the FFN $\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_5\right)$. This addition operation is
element-wise, where corresponding elements of the two tensors are added
together.

For the first layer ($\ell = 1$), the residual connection step can be written
as:

$$
\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_{\text{out}} = \mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_3 + \mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_5
$$

The output of this step, $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_{\text{out}}$, becomes the input
to the next decoder block.
```

### Iterative Process Through L Decoder Blocks

Let $\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_{\text{out}}$ be the output of the first decoder block.
This output becomes the input to the next decoder block, and the process
continues iteratively. Each decoder block builds upon the output of the previous
block through a series of mathematical transformations. The subscript notation
$\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_i$ indicates the i-th step output of the $\ell$-th decoder
block.

#### First Decoder Block ($\ell = 1$)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_1 &= \operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\tilde{\mathbf{X}}\right) & \text{(Initial normalization of inputs)} \\
\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_2 &= \operatorname{MaskedMultiHead}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_1, \mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_1, \mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_1\right) & \text{(Self-attention mechanism)} \\
\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_3 &= \tilde{\mathbf{X}} + \mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_2 & \text{(Addition of the first residual connection)} \\
\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_4 &= \operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_3\right) & \text{(Normalization before FFN)}\\
\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_5 &= \operatorname{FFN}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_4\right) & \text{(Feed-forward network)}\\
\mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_{\text{out}} &= \mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_3 + \mathbf{Z}^{(1)}_5 & \text{(Second residual connection)}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Subsequent Decoder Blocks ($\ell > 1$)

For each subsequent decoder block $\ell$, the output of the previous block's
final step $\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell-1)}_{\text{out}}$ serves as the input for the
current block's operations.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1 &= \operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell-1)}_{\text{out}}\right) & \text{(Normalization of previous block's output)} \\
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2 &= \operatorname{MaskedMultiHead}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1, \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1, \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_1\right) & \text{(Self-attention mechanism)} \\
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3 &= \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell-1)}_{\text{out}} + \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_2 & \text{(First residual connection post self-attention)} \\
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_4 &= \operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3\right) & \text{(Normalization before FFN)}\\
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_5 &= \operatorname{FFN}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_4\right) & \text{(Feed-forward network)}\\
\mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_{\text{out}} &= \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_3 + \mathbf{Z}^{(\ell)}_5 & \text{(Second residual connection post FFN)}
\end{aligned}
$$

After processing the input through a total of $L$ decoder blocks, the final
output is denoted as $\mathbf{Z}^{(L)}_{\text{out}}$, which is the output of the
last decoder block. The shape of $\mathbf{Z}^{(L)}_{\text{out}}$ is
$\mathcal{B} \times T \times D$, where $\mathcal{B}$ is the batch size, $T$ is
the sequence length, and $D$ is the hidden dimension.

### Layer Normalization Before Projection

```{admonition} Step 10. Layer Normalization Before Projection
:class: note

The final output of the decoder block $\mathbf{Z}^{(L)}_{\text{out}}$ undergoes
a layer normalization step before being projected to the vocabulary space. This
step is commonly referred to as the "pre-projection layer normalization" or
"final layer normalization" in the context of the Transformer/GPT architecture.

The pre-projection/head layer normalization can be represented as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}_{\text{pre-head}} &= \operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\mathbf{Z}^{(L)}_{\text{out}}\right) \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \operatorname{LayerNorm}\left(\mathcal{B} \times T \times D\right) \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times D &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D
\end{aligned}
$$

where:

-   $\mathbf{Z}^{(L)}_{\text{out}} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}$
    is the output of the last decoder block ($\ell = L$).
-   $\operatorname{LayerNorm}(\cdot)$ denotes the Layer Normalization operation,
    which normalizes the activations across the feature dimension $D$ for each
    token independently.
-   $\mathbf{Z}_{\text{pre-proj}} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}$
    is the normalized output, which is ready to be projected to the vocabulary
    space.

The usual purpose of applying layer normalization before the projection step is
to stabilize the activations and improve training stability.
```

### Head

The final step in the GPT architecture is to project the normalized output of
the last decoder block, $\mathbf{Z}_{\text{pre-head}}$, to the vocabulary space.
This projection is performed using a linear transformation, where the weights of
the projection layer are denoted as
$\mathbf{W}_{s} \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times V}$. The subscript $s$ indicates that
this is the projection layer before the softmax operation, and $V$ represents
the size of the vocabulary.

Mathematically, the projection operation can be expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z} &= \mathbf{Z}_{\text{pre-head}} \mathbf{W}_{s} \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times V &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times D \times \operatorname{@} D \times V \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times V &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times V
\end{aligned}
$$

where:

-   $\mathbf{Z}_{\text{pre-head}} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times D}$
    is the normalized output from the pre-projection layer normalization step
    (Step 12).
-   $\mathbf{W}_{s} \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times V}$ is the weight matrix of the
    projection layer, which maps the hidden dimension $D$ to the vocabulary size
    $V$.
-   $\mathbf{Z} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times V}$ is the resulting
    logits tensor, representing the unnormalized scores for each token in the
    vocabulary at each position in the sequence.

The purpose of the projection layer is to map the hidden representations from
the decoder to the vocabulary space, allowing the model to generate probability
distributions over the vocabulary for each token position. The logits tensor
$\mathbf{Z}$ can be further processed by applying a softmax function to obtain
the final probability distribution for token prediction.

### Softmax Layer

The softmax function is applied to the logits tensor
$\mathbf{Z} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times V}$ to obtain the
predicted probability distribution over the vocabulary for each token position
in the sequence. The softmax operation is performed vector-wise along the
vocabulary dimension (i.e., the last dimension) of $\mathbf{Z}$ independently
for each token position and each instance in the batch.

The softmax operation can be defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{P} &= \operatorname{softmax}(\mathbf{Z}) \\
\mathbf{P}_{b,t,v} &= \frac{\exp(\mathbf{Z}_{b,t,v})}{\sum_{v'=1}^{V} \exp(\mathbf{Z}_{b,t,v'})} \\
\mathcal{B} \times T \times V &\leftarrow \mathcal{B} \times T \times V
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mathbf{P} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times V}$ is the
resulting probability tensor, and $\mathbf{P}_{b,t,v}$ represents the predicted
probability of token $v$ at position $t$ in the sequence for batch instance $b$.
The softmax function ensures that the probabilities sum to 1 along the
vocabulary dimension for each token position and each batch instance, i.e.,
$\sum_{v=1}^{V} \mathbf{P}_{b,t,v} = 1$ for all $b \in {1, \ldots, \mathcal{B}}$
and $t \in {1, \ldots, T}$.

```python
m = nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
input = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)
output = m(input)

torch.testing.assert_close(output.sum(-1), torch.ones(2, 3))
```

The softmax operation is applied independently to each row of the last two
dimensions $(T \times V)$ of the logits tensor $\mathbf{Z}$, while the batch
dimension $\mathcal{B}$ remains unchanged. This means that for each batch
instance $b$ and each token position $t$, the softmax function takes the
corresponding row vector $\mathbf{Z}_{b,t,:} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times V}$ and
computes the predicted probability distribution
$\mathbf{P}_{b,t,:} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times V}$ over the vocabulary.

### Cross-Entropy Loss Function

The cross-entropy loss function $\mathcal{L}$ is used to measure the
dissimilarity between the predicted probability distribution $\mathbf{P}$ and
the true token distribution $\mathbf{Y}$. The true token distribution is
typically represented as a one-hot encoded tensor
$\mathbf{Y} \in \{0, 1\}^{\mathcal{B} \times T \times V}$ (though in practice we
just pass in a non one-hot encoded version).

The one-hot encoded tensor $\mathbf{Y}$ has the same shape as the predicted
probability tensor $\mathbf{P}$, i.e., $\mathcal{B} \times T \times V$. For each
batch instance $b$ and each token position $t$, the corresponding row vector
$\mathbf{Y}_{b,t,:} \in {0, 1}^{1 \times V}$ represents the true token
distribution, where the element corresponding to the true token is set to 1, and
all other elements are set to 0.

The one-hot encoded tensor $\mathbf{Y}$ can be defined as follows:

$$
\mathbf{Y}_{b,t,v} = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } v = v^*_{b,t} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where $v^*_{b,t}$ denotes the true token at position $t$ in the sequence for
batch instance $b$.

The cross-entropy loss function $\mathcal{L}$ is then defined as:

$$
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{\mathcal{B} \cdot T} \sum_{b=1}^{\mathcal{B}} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{v=1}^{V} \mathbf{Y}_{b,t,v} \log(\mathbf{P}_{b,t,v})
$$

where $\mathbf{Y}_{b,t,v}$ is the one-hot encoded true token indicator, and
$\mathbf{P}_{b,t,v}$ is the predicted probability of token $v$ at position $t$
in the sequence for batch instance $b$. Note carefully that the sum is over all
batch instances, all token positions, and all tokens in the vocabulary.

### Table of Notations

In the table below, we will not add notational burden by adding superscript
$\mathcal{B}$ to indicate a certain tensor is batched. We would just assume that
all tensors are batched unless otherwise stated.
