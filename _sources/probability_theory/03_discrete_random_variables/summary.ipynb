    "    sake of the example, since discrete numbers are easier to visualize. Also\n",

    "-   In our case if we treat $X: \\S \\to \\R$ as a r.v, then it is obvious that the\n",
    "    sample space $\\S$ is all from 0 to 100 and for this case our mapping to $\\R$\n",
    "    is just the identity function, since the height of a person is a real number\n",
    "    ( a random variable is a way to assign a numerical code to each possible\n",
    "    outcome). This aside, what is more important is that we say $X$ is a r.v.\n",

    "-   In ml context, Random variables $X_1, X_2, \\ldots X_{???}$ are the data\n",

    "-   I was confused because $X: \\S \\to \\R$ is a r.v. that represents the height\n",
    "    of a person, say if $100 cm \\in \\S$, then $X(100) = 100 cm$ is the realized\n",
    "    outcome. Then why do we need to index the data points? Because the mapping\n",
    "    of $X$ is already well defined for any outcome in $\\S$, so for each person\n",
    "    in the world we already can represent the single random variable $X$ that\n",
    "    represents the height of that person. So why do we need to index the data\n",
    "    points?\n",
    "-   For example, most cited definition is the iid assumption: random variables\n",
    "    $X_1, X_2, \\ldots X_{n}$ are called independent and identically distributed\n",
    "    or iid if the variables are mutually independent, and each $X_i$ has the\n",
    "    same probability distribution. Say $n=10$ people. It turns out we should\n",
    "    think of it this way, in the true population box, all the tickets (height)\n",
    "    of the people are **numbered**, and each $X_i$ is actually remember is a\n",
    "    deterministic answer after realization, and therefore the numbering makes\n",
    "    sense. We treat each draw of the ticket as a random variable, and the\n",
    "    numbering is just a way to index the random variables.\n",
    "-   Furthermore, we usually take a random sample of size $n$ from the population\n",
    "    box, and treat each draw as a rv.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Super important\n",
    "\n",
    "Above has a hazy concept, one one hand sample space is a set and therefore\n",
    "should be unique, but on the other hand, if there's 1000 people in the true\n",
    "population, and we treat the population box as the sample space, then the sample\n",
    "space is no longer \"unique\" since there are only 100 distinct heights? However,\n",
    "if we number the tickets, then the sample space is unique, in a way we are\n",
    "playing abuse of notation that two different people with the same height 175 cm\n",
    "are two distinct outcomes in the sample space. This is very important to\n",
