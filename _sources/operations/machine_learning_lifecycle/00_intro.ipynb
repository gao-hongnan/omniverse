    "**Artificial Intelligence for ML Operations (AIOps)** has emerged as a powerful\n",
    "approach to managing complex Machine Learning (ML) environments. By leveraging\n",
    "[AI](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence),\n",
    "[machine learning](https://www.expert.ai/blog/machine-learning-definition/), and\n",

    "AIOps enables ML teams to automate and optimize various aspects of their\n",
    "operations, improving efficiency and reducing downtime. In this documentation,\n",
    "we'll explore the lifecycle of an AIOps system, providing insights into how\n",
    "these systems are developed, implemented, and maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Google's article\n",
    "[MLOps: Continuous delivery and automation pipelines in machine learning](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning),\n",
    "the authors defined 9 key steps in the lifecycle of an AIOps system. We will\n",
    "refine it below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Problem Formulation](01_problem_formulation.md)\n",
    "2. [Project Scoping](02_project_scoping.md)\n",
    "3. [Data Pipeline, Data Engineering and DataOps](./03_dataops_pipeline/03_dataops_pipeline.md)\n",

    "5. [Model Development, Selection and Training](./05_model_development_selection_and_training/05_ml_training_pipeline.md):\n",
    "   The data scientist implements different algorithms with the prepared data to\n",
    "   train various ML models. In addition, you subject the implemented algorithms\n",
    "   to **hyperparameter tuning** to get the best performing ML model. The output\n",
    "   of this step is a **trained model**.\n",
    "6. [Model Evaluation](06_model_evaluation.md): The model is evaluated on a\n",
    "   [**holdout test set**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets#Holdout_dataset)\n",
    "   to evaluate the model quality. The output of this step is a set of\n",
    "   **metrics** to assess the quality of the model.\n",
    "7. [Model Validation, Registry and Pushing Model to Production](07_model_validation_registry_and_pushing_model_to_production.md):\n",
    "   The model is confirmed to be adequate for deploymentâ€”that its **predictive\n",
    "   performance** is better than a certain baseline.\n",
    "8. [Model Deployment and Serving](08_model_deployment_and_serving.md): The\n",
    "   validated model is deployed to a target environment to serve predictions.\n",
    "   This deployment can be one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Microservices** with a REST API to serve online predictions.\n",
    "    - An **embedded model** to an edge or mobile device.\n",
    "    - Part of a **batch prediction system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. [Model Monitoring](09_model_monitoring.md): The model is monitored to ensure\n",
    "   that it continues to perform as expected. This monitoring can be one of the\n",
    "   following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Anomaly detection** to detect unexpected behavior in the model.\n",
    "    - **Drift detection** to detect changes in the data distribution.\n",
    "    - **Performance monitoring** to detect changes in the model performance.\n",
