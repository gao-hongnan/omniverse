**Artificial Intelligence for ML Operations (AIOps)** has emerged as a powerful
approach to managing complex Machine Learning (ML) environments. By leveraging
[AI](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence),
[machine learning](https://www.expert.ai/blog/machine-learning-definition/), and
[data analytics](https://www.oracle.com/data-analytics/what-is-data-analytics/),
AIOps enables ML teams to automate and optimize various aspects of their
operations, improving efficiency and reducing downtime. In this documentation,
we'll explore the lifecycle of an AIOps system, providing insights into how
these systems are developed, implemented, and maintained.

In Google's article
[MLOps: Continuous delivery and automation pipelines in machine learning](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning),
the authors defined 9 key steps in the lifecycle of an AIOps system. We will
refine it below.

1. [Problem Formulation](01_problem_formulation.md)
2. [Project Scoping](02_project_scoping.md)
3. [Data Pipeline, Data Engineering and DataOps](03_dataops_pipeline.md)
4. [Data Extraction](04_data_extraction.md): In this stage, you select and
   integrate the relevant data from various data sources for the ML task. **Data
   extraction** is crucial for ensuring that the AIOps system has access to all
   necessary information to make accurate predictions and recommendations.
5. [Data Analysis](05_data_analysis.md)

    - Understanding the **data schema** and characteristics that are expected by
      the model.
    - Identifying the **data preparation** and **feature engineering** needed
      for the model.

6. [Data Preparation](06_data_preparation.md): The data is prepared for the ML
   task. This preparation involves **data cleaning**, where you split the data
   into **training, validation, and test sets**. You also apply **data
   transformations** and **feature engineering** to the model that solves the
   target task. The output of this step is the data splits in the prepared
   format.
7. [Model Development, Selection and Training](07_model_development_selection_and_training.md):
   The data scientist implements different algorithms with the prepared data to
   train various ML models. In addition, you subject the implemented algorithms
   to **hyperparameter tuning** to get the best performing ML model. The output
   of this step is a **trained model**.
8. [Model Evaluation](08_model_evaluation.md): The model is evaluated on a
   [**holdout test set**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets#Holdout_dataset)
   to evaluate the model quality. The output of this step is a set of
   **metrics** to assess the quality of the model.
9. [Model Validation, Registry and Pushing Model to Production](09_model_validation_registry_and_pushing_model_to_production.md):
   The model is confirmed to be adequate for deploymentâ€”that its **predictive
   performance** is better than a certain baseline.
10. [Model Deployment and Serving](10_model_deployment_and_serving.md): The
    validated model is deployed to a target environment to serve predictions.
    This deployment can be one of the following:

    - **Microservices** with a REST API to serve online predictions.
    - An **embedded model** to an edge or mobile device.
    - Part of a **batch prediction system**.

11. [Model Monitoring](11_model_monitoring.md): The model is monitored to ensure
    that it continues to perform as expected. This monitoring can be one of the
    following:

    - **Anomaly detection** to detect unexpected behavior in the model.
    - **Drift detection** to detect changes in the data distribution.
    - **Performance monitoring** to detect changes in the model performance.

12. [Continuous Integration, Deployment, Learning and Training](12_continuous_integration_deployment_learning_and_training.md)
13. [Infrastructure and Tooling for MLOps](13_infrastructure_and_tooling_for_mlops.md)
