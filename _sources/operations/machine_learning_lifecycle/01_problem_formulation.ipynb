    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the development of an AIOps system, the first step is to clearly define the\n",
    "problem you intend to solve and appropriately scope the project. This stage\n",
    "involves **identifying the business problem**, **clarifying requirements**,\n",
    "**determining constraints**, and **establishing metrics for success**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding business requirements and stakeholder motivations is crucial to\n",
    "ensure the AIOps system meets the needs of the users and organization. Discuss\n",
    "these requirements in-depth, along with any technical constraints or\n",
    "assumptions, to guide the project effectively and to meet stakeholder needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial task is to\n",
    "**[identify the business problem and its objectives](https://medium.com/codex/how-to-scope-a-machine-learning-project-d74d4025e04c)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identify the Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we _identify the business problem_ that the AIOps system aims to solve.\n",
    "This part of the task involves clearly understanding and defining the specific\n",
    "issue or challenge that the business is facing. It could relate to an\n",
    "inefficiency, a lost opportunity, a market need, or any other problem that the\n",
    "organization wants to address.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to identifying the problem, this task requires setting out the\n",
    "_goals_ or _objectives_ that need to be achieved in order to address or solve\n",
    "the problem. These objectives guide the solution and provide criteria for\n",
    "measuring success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Business Problem**: A streaming platform has a vast catalog of movies, but\n",
    "    users often find it **challenging** to discover movies that align with their\n",
    "    interests. This leads to **decreased engagement and satisfaction** with the\n",
    "    platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Objective**: **Enhance user engagement and satisfaction** by developing a\n",
    "    movie recommendation system that provides **personalized recommendations**\n",
    "    to users based on their viewing history, preferences, and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring Success\n",
    "\n",
    "Having identified the specific business problem and outlined the objectives, it\n",
    "is essential to determine how success will be measured. This requires the\n",
    "establishment of clear and relevant **business metrics**, which align with the\n",
    "overall goals and allow for the continuous assessment of the AIOps system's\n",
    "impact. The selection of these metrics will be driven by the unique aspects of\n",
    "the problem being solved and may include aspects related to digital marketing\n",
    "and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Business metrics are quantifiable measures that track and assess the performance\n",
    "of a business process. They are used to gauge the success of a business strategy\n",
    "or initiative, and are often tied to specific business objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of machine learning, beyond our familiar machine learning\n",
    "metrics, we need to ensure that these metrics can translate into business value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Example On Movie Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "**Movie recommendation systems** utilize algorithms to analyze user behavior and\n",
    "preferences to suggest movies that a user is likely to enjoy. They play a\n",
    "critical role in driving user engagement and revenue for streaming platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{list-table}\n",
    ":name: business-metrics-movie-recommendation\n",
    ":header-rows: 1\n",
    ":widths: 25 75\n",
    "\n",
    "-   -   Metric\n",
    "    -   Description\n",
    "-   -   User Engagement Rate\n",
    "    -   Measures the percentage of users interacting with recommended movies.\n",
    "        High engagement rates may indicate that the recommendations are aligned\n",
    "        with user preferences.\n",
    "-   -   Click-Through Rate (CTR) on Recommended Movies\n",
    "    -   The percentage of users who click on a recommended movie to view more\n",
    "        details or watch the trailer. A high CTR may reflect the relevancy of\n",
    "        the recommendations.\n",
    "-   -   Conversion Rate\n",
    "    -   In this context, conversion rate refers to the percentage of users who\n",
    "        proceed to watch a recommended movie. This is a key metric in assessing\n",
    "        the effectiveness of the recommendation system in driving viewership.\n",
    "-   -   Average Viewing Duration of Recommended Movies\n",
    "    -   This metric assesses how long users are watching the recommended movies.\n",
    "        If viewers are watching these movies for a significant duration, it may\n",
    "        suggest that the recommendations are resonating with their preferences.\n",
    "-   -   Churn Rate\n",
    "    -   Measures the percentage of subscribers who cancel their subscription\n",
    "        within a given period. If the recommendation system is ineffective,\n",
    "        leading to dissatisfaction, the churn rate may increase.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these business metrics to a movie recommendation system, a streaming\n",
    "platform can gauge the success of its recommendation algorithms, understand how\n",
    "users are interacting with recommendations, and make data-driven decisions to\n",
    "enhance the user experience and meet business objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Business Metrics to Machine Learning Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's essential to define the business metrics that align with the overall\n",
    "goals of the project, when framing the problem within the context of machine\n",
    "learning, a transformation of these metrics is often necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take, for example, the customer churn rate, defined as the proportion of\n",
    "customers who discontinue a company's product or service within a specified\n",
    "period. In a business context, minimizing the churn rate is a prevalent goal, as\n",
    "it often proves more economically efficient to retain existing customers than to\n",
    "procure new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "This goal can be translated into the machine learning domain by formulating it\n",
    "as a binary classification problem. Here, the task becomes predicting whether a\n",
    "given customer will churn or not. By structuring the problem in this manner, it\n",
    "becomes feasible to apply machine learning techniques to achieve the business\n",
    "objective of reducing churn and evaluate using typical classification metrics\n",
    "such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUROC, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clarifying Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "When given a problem, many often rush to build a model without fully\n",
    "understanding the requirements. This can lead to suboptimal solutions that do\n",
    "not meet the needs of the stakeholders. It is always good to take a step back\n",
    "and clarify the requirements before committing to a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarifying requirements involves posing key questions such as the in\n",
    "{ref}`table below <clarifying-requirements-aiops-system>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{list-table} Clarifying Requirements for an AIOps System\n",
    ":name: clarifying-requirements-aiops-system\n",
    ":header-rows: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "-   -   Requirement Category\n",
    "    -   Questions and Details\n",
    "-   -   Baseline\n",
    "    -   Is there a pre-existing solution or system for this problem? If so, how\n",
    "        well is it performing?\n",
    "-   -   Benefit Structure\n",
    "    -   What are the anticipated benefits or improvements with the\n",

    "        (assuming a classification problem)?\n",
    "-   -   Features\n",
    "    -   Are there specific features that stakeholders expect in the solution?\n",
    "        For instance, in a TikTok video recommendation system, stakeholders may\n",

    "        the system?\n",
    "-   -   Constraints\n",
    "    -   Are there any technical, financial, or operational constraints? These\n",
    "        might include system latency requirements, project budget, or data\n",
    "        privacy issues.\n",
    "-   -   Scale\n",
    "    -   How large is the problem? For example, how many users will the system\n",
    "        serve? How much data will the system handle?\n",
    "-   -   Performance\n",
    "    -   What are the performance requirements? Does the solution need to\n",
    "        function in real-time, or can offline processing suffice?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This list is by no means exhaustive, and one must be prepared that requirements\n",
    "may evolve or change as the project progresses. However, having a clear\n",
    "understanding of the requirements at the outset can help guide the project in\n",
    "the right direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a baseline? Baseline is the assessment of any existing **solutions** or\n",
    "**systems** that address the **problem**, including an evaluation of their\n",
    "**performance**. It serves as a starting point for measuring **improvements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Establishing a baseline is crucial in the early stages of project development. A\n",
    "baseline could be an existing model or system that your AIOps solution will be\n",
    "compared against. For instance, suppose your task is to improve the vacation\n",
    "rental recommendation system. If there's already a model in place, its\n",
    "performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.) can serve as a\n",
    "benchmark. If no such model exists, a simple statistical approach or a\n",
    "rule-based system might serve as your baseline. Understanding the baseline helps\n",
    "to set realistic performance goals and provides context on how much improvement\n",
    "is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefit Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The **analysis** of anticipated **advantages** or **enhancements** that come\n",
    "with the **implementation** of the **system**. In the context of\n",
    "**classification problems**, it can involve deciding the importance between\n",
    "**precision** and **recall**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit structure is the expected outcome or value from implementing the AIOps\n",
    "system. Often it can manifest as a cost-benefit analysis, where the costs of\n",
    "different outcomes are weighed against the benefits. Let's see an example of a\n",
    "benefit structure in a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a spam detection system, the business metrics would likely\n",
    "revolve around enhancing user experience, trust, and operational efficiency. We\n",
    "can naively define two business metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Experience and Trust**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Metric**: User Satisfaction Rate\n",
    "    - **Description**: The percentage of users who are satisfied with the spam\n",
    "      filtering system, reflecting the balance between filtering out spam and\n",
    "      not misclassifying legitimate emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Operational Efficiency**:\n",
    "    - **Metric**: Spam Filtering Efficiency\n",
    "    - **Description**: The number of spam emails successfully filtered out as a\n",
    "      proportion of total spam emails received. This measures how effectively\n",
    "      the system is working in real operational terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can define the corresponding machine learning metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **False Positive Impact**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Metric**: False Positive Rate (FPR)\n",
    "    - **Description**: The number of legitimate emails marked as spam as a\n",
    "      proportion of total legitimate emails received. This could have business\n",
    "      implications such as lost opportunities, missed communications, or\n",
    "      decreased user trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **False Negative Impact**:\n",
    "    - **Metric**: False Negative Rate (FNR)\n",
    "    - **Description**: The number of spam emails not marked as spam as a\n",
    "      proportion of total spam emails received. This could have business\n",
    "      implications such as decreased user trust or increased operational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, there is a trade-off between precision (favoring FPR) and recall\n",
    "(favoring FNR). In the context of spam detection, the business may prioritize\n",
    "minimizing false positives over false negatives, as the cost of misclassifying a\n",
    "legitimate email as spam could lead to missed opportunities or dissatisfaction,\n",
    "and thus, it's associated with a higher cost. Therefore, the model might be\n",
    "tuned to favor precision over recall. However, this trade-off should be\n",
    "carefully evaluated based on the specific business needs and the relative\n",
    "importance of user trust, operational efficiency, and other relevant factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then formulate a benefit structure using mathematical terms. Below, I'm\n",
    "assuming that the cost and benefit are expressed in monetary units (e.g.,\n",
    "dollars), and these values are hypothetical and adjustable based on the specific\n",
    "business context.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Outcome             | Description                                 | Benefit/Cost  |\n",
    "| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |\n",
    "| True Positive (TP)  | Spam correctly identified as spam           | Benefit: \\$10 |\n",
    "| True Negative (TN)  | Legitimate email correctly identified       | Benefit: \\$5  |\n",
    "| False Positive (FP) | Legitimate email incorrectly marked as spam | Cost: -\\$200  |\n",
    "| False Negative (FN) | Spam incorrectly marked as legitimate       | Cost: -\\$100  |\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **True Positive (TP)**: Correctly identifying spam might save resources and\n",
    "    enhance user experience, so it's associated with a benefit.\n",
    "-   **True Negative (TN)**: Correctly identifying a legitimate email might be\n",
    "    less valuable but still provides a benefit in terms of user trust and\n",
    "    engagement.\n",
    "-   **False Positive (FP)**: Misclassifying a legitimate email as spam could\n",
    "    lead to missed opportunities or dissatisfaction, so it's associated with a\n",
    "    cost. This is usually worse than a false negative since it could lead to\n",
    "    lost business.\n",
    "-   **False Negative (FN)**: Failing to identify spam could lead to more\n",
    "    significant issues like security risks, thus incurring a higher cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table helps in quantifying the trade-offs in designing the spam detection\n",
    "system. By assigning specific monetary values to each outcome, it provides a\n",
    "concrete way to evaluate different models and to tune the system according to\n",
    "business priorities. It can guide decision-making around the trade-off between\n",
    "precision and recall and the overall cost-effectiveness of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Medical Diagnosis Favours Recall\n",
    ":class: note\n",
    "\n",
    "In medical diagnosis (positive = cancer), the cost of a false negative is\n",
    "usually higher than the cost of a false positive. For instance, a false\n",
    "negative in cancer detection could lead to a delayed diagnosis and treatment,\n",
    "which could be life threatening. In this case, the cost of a false negative is\n",
    "higher than the cost of a false positive. However, in the case of a spam\n",
    "detection system, a false positive is usually worse than a false negative, as\n",
    "it could lead to missed opportunities or dissatisfaction. In this case, the\n",
    "cost of a false positive is higher than the cost of a false negative.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for other problems like recommendation systems, the benefit structure\n",
    "could be different. For instance, in a recommendation system, the benefit\n",
    "structure could be based on user engagement and satisfaction. The corresponding\n",
    "metrics could be things like Precision@K, Recall@K, or NDCG@K, where K is the\n",
    "number of recommendations shown to the user.\n",
