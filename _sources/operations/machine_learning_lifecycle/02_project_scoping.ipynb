    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the problem statement from a business point of view, the next\n",
    "step is to scope the project and frame the problem in the context of machine\n",
    "learning (that is if the problem warrants a machine learning solution in the\n",
    "first place). This involves identifying the inputs, outputs, objective function,\n",
    "and the type of machine learning task that best suits the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going too deep into the details, we can treat a machine learning problem\n",
    "as a triplet - (data, model, objective function). We can then scope out things\n",
    "like what input/features/labels/outputs we need as a first cut for baseline/MVP,\n",
    "and on the model side one would envision choosing a suitable architecture/task\n",
    "(i.e. classification/regression) - but don't be restricted to one as complex use\n",
    "case can involve multi-stage tasks, or multi-modalities (think ChatGPT). We\n",
    "would also need to establish metrics/loss/objective functions and remember\n",
    "ultimately the metrics you optimize should necessarily correlate with the\n",
    "business metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections we will go deeper into the process of framing real-world\n",
    "problems as machine learning tasks, knowing how to define inputs and outputs,\n",
    "identifying objective functions, and recognizing the specific machine learning\n",
    "tasks that best suit different types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frame a Business Problem as an Machine Learning Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first section, we discuss a simplified example taken from Chip Huyen's\n",
    "book _Design Machine Learning Systems_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Example On E-commerce Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the example of a popular online e-commerce platform. They are looking\n",
    "to increase the user engagement on their website, which in turn will lead to\n",
    "increased purchases, thereby raising the company's overall profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, increasing user engagement might not seem like a machine\n",
    "learning problem, but with a little bit of investigation and framing, it can be\n",
    "turned into one.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing a thorough analysis, the ML engineering team finds out that users\n",
    "often abandon the platform because they struggle to find the items they are\n",
    "interested in. The vast array of products on the website becomes overwhelming,\n",
    "resulting in a frustrating experience for the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these insights, the team decides to frame the problem as a machine learning\n",
    "task - **recommendation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: User's past browsing and purchase history, demographics, and other\n",
    "   user metadata.\n",
    "2. **Output**: A personalized list of recommended products.\n",
    "3. **Objective Function**:\n",
    "   **[Maximize click-through rate (CTR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate)**\n",
    "   of the recommended items.\n",
    "4. **Machine Learning Task**:\n",
    "   **[Recommendation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By formulating this as a recommendation problem, the team can now use machine\n",
    "learning to learn the user's preferences and suggest items they would be\n",
    "interested in, making the browsing process more efficient and enjoyable for the\n",

    "-   -   Inputs\n",
    "    -   These are the raw materials that the model will use to make predictions\n",
    "        or decisions. Inputs can range from numerical data, text, images,\n",
    "        videos, to audio, or any combination thereof. Identifying the right\n",
    "        inputs is essential, and note that sometimes you have a combination of\n",
    "        inputs (i.e. text + image - multi-modal inputs).\n",
    "-   -   Outputs\n",
    "    -   These represent the predictions or decisions that the model will make\n",
    "        based on the given inputs. Outputs might be continuous values, discrete\n",

    "-   -   Objective Function\n",
    "    -   This defines the specific goal that the machine learning algorithm aims\n",

    "        maximization of accuracy in a classification task, or any other\n",
    "        quantifiable metric that guides the learning process. The choice of the\n",

    "-   -   Type of Machine Learning Task\n",
    "    -   Identifying the type of machine learning task involves categorizing the\n",
    "        problem into a specific paradigm, such as classification, regression,\n",
    "        clustering, recommendation, nlp or computer vision.\n",
    "        This categorization informs the\n",
    "        selection of appropriate algorithms, techniques, and evaluation metrics.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features, Labels and Outputs (Inputs/Outputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the nature of the inputs and outputs for your machine learning or\n",
    "deep learning task is crucial as it directly influences your data collection\n",
    "strategy, the selection and design of the model architecture, and even the\n",
    "deployment of the model. For instance, if you are working on a text\n",
    "classification task, the input data would be the text documents, and the output\n",
    "would be the predicted class labels along with the confidence scores (or\n",
    "logits).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms \"features\" and \"labels\" are frequently used in the context of\n",
    "supervised learning. The features represent the input data, which can take a\n",
    "multitude of forms including numerical data, categorical data, text, images,\n",
    "video, audio, and more. The labels, on the other hand, represent the outputs or\n",
    "the target variables we want the model to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of the task dictates the format of these features and labels. For\n",
    "example, in an image classification task, the features would be the raw image\n",
    "pixels and the labels would be the class or category of each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if labels are not readily available or are difficult and\n",
    "costly to obtain, you might consider alternative strategies such as\n",
    "semi-supervised or self-supervised learning. In these approaches, the model\n",
    "leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to learn. For example, Generative\n",
    "Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models are trained on vast amounts of text data\n",
    "without explicit labels, learning to predict the next word in a sentence where\n",
    "we use the model's input as the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features (Inputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs** (features) represent the raw data or features that the algorithm will\n",
    "process to generate predictions or decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In {ref}`the table below <ml-lifecycle-02-types-of-data-inputs>`, we outline the\n",
    "different types of data inputs that machine learning models can process. These\n",
    "include numerical data, categorical data, text data, and multimedia data.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the above are not mutually exclusive and you might have a combination of\n",
    "these data types as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An Example On Medical Diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a medical diagnosis on cancer, inputs might include patient\n",
    "**[medical history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history)**,\n",
    "**[symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom)**,\n",
    "**[lab results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test)** and\n",
    "**[medical images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could jolly well be a multi-modal input, where the model takes in both\n",
    "images and text as inputs. For example, if you were to predict the presence of\n",
    "cancer in a patient, you might use the patient's medical history and symptoms as\n",
    "text inputs and medical images (like X-rays or MRIs) as image inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs (Predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs** refer to the predictions, decisions, or insights that a machine\n",
    "learning model generates based on the defined inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relationship to Business Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs must be carefully crafted to reflect the ultimate goals and success\n",
    "metrics of the organization. Whether it's predicting\n",
    "**[customer churn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_attrition)**,\n",
    "optimizing\n",
    "**[supply chain operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain)**, or\n",
    "identifying **[fraudulent transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud)**,\n",
    "the outputs must provide actionable insights that drive decision-making and\n",
    "align with overarching business strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may mean that interpretable models are preferred over black-box models when\n",
    "the business requires explainable results. What this means is that some model\n",
    "like neural networks are not well-calibrated. What this means that the\n",
    "probability predictions (logits) of the model do not reflect the _actual\n",
    "likelihood_ of the event happening. In simpler terms, if such a model predicts a\n",
    "90% probability of an event happening, it might not actually happen 90% of the\n",
    "time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs and Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose we want to develop a model to detect Personal Protective\n",
    "Equipment (PPE) in construction sites and although we have abundance of input\n",
    "images (inputs) but we do not have enough bounding box labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's two possible approaches to tackle this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Self-Supervised Learning**: Since we do not have enough resources for\n",
    "   manual labelling, we can use a pre-trained model like YOLO to infer human\n",
    "   bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pseudo-Labeling**: We manually label a small set of about 200 images with\n",
    "   PPE details. Then, we train a model to overfit these 200 images, ensuring it\n",
    "   becomes adept at identifying PPE in these specific images. After this, we can\n",
    "   use this model to generate pseudo-labels for the rest of our data, thus\n",
    "   significantly reducing the amount of manual labelling required.\n",
    "\n",
    "To proceed with this, we could prepare an input CSV file with the following\n",
    "columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Human ID (for grouping CV strat)\n",
    "-   Label (for stratification)\n",
    "-   Image ID\n",
    "-   Image Path (for loading image)\n",
    "\n",
    "This CSV based approach is useful for small datasets, but for larger datasets,\n",
    "you might consider using a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL or even those\n",
    "optimized data lake/data warehouse solutions like AWS S3 or Google BigQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of the model will be the bounding boxes and class labels of detected\n",
    "PPE gear in each image or video frame. Each detected object (helmet, mask, vest,\n",
    "etc.) would have a bounding box (indicating its location and size in the image)\n",
    "and a class label (identifying the type of PPE). The model might also provide a\n",
    "confidence score showing the model's certainty about the detected object's\n",
    "class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "These raw outputs can be processed further to generate more useful information,\n",
    "such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Binary indication of PPE compliance for each worker.\n",
    "-   An overall PPE compliance score for the site at a given time.\n",
    "-   Alerts or notifications triggered by any detected non-compliance.\n",
    "-   Aggregated statistics over time, such as compliance rates by worker, time of\n",
    "    day, area of the site, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also save the embeddings for further analysis such as model\n",
    "explainability and interpretability. Embeddings can also detect data drift and\n",
    "concept drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning Objective (Establishing Metrics)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key steps in formulating a machine learning problem is defining the\n",
    "business objectives and then translating them into quantifiable and measureable\n",
    "metrics. Business objectives could range from increasing revenue and viewership\n",
    "to improving click-through rates. But these high-level objectives are often not\n",
    "directly measurable and can't be used to evaluate the performance of the machine\n",
    "learning system directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can we connect these business objectives to machine learning objectives?\n",
    "The first step is to translate the business problem into a machine learning\n",
    "problem. Once this is achieved, we can then define a well-specified objective\n",
    "function for the machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a formal machine learning theory review, so we will be less pedantic\n",
    "and mix the idea of loss, cost, objective and performance metrics in one\n",
    "section.\n",
    "\n",
    "While **establishing metrics**, we need to consider both\n",
    "**[offline metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offline_learning)** (used\n",

    "Offline metrics are used during the model development and validation phases. For\n",
    "instance, in a classification problem where we are trying to detect if an email\n",

    "**[MAPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error)** can be\n",
    "used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model is in a production environment, online metrics become important.\n",
    "For web applications, metrics such as\n",
    "**[Click-through Rate (CTR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate)**\n",
    "might be appropriate, while for applications such as credit card scanning,\n",
    "metrics such as Failures and Manual Keying might be more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, after deploying a model in a production environment, such as a web\n",
    "application that predicts the animal in user-uploaded images, it's crucial to\n",
    "develop online metrics to assess its performance. One such metric is\n",
    "Click-Through Rate (CTR), which indicates user engagement and helps attract more\n",
    "visitors to the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider another scenario where a smartphone application that scans credit card\n",
    "details to autofill user information. This process can be seen as an object\n",
    "detection task, where the app first localizes and classifies the credit card\n",
    "amongst other objects in the camera's view. Subsequently, Optical Character\n",
    "Recognition (OCR) is performed to extract the necessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, an effective online metric would be the number of times users\n",
    "fail and revert to manual data entry. This metric helps gauge the app's\n",
    "performance and user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Functional Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, don't forget to consider **non-functional metrics** like training speed\n",
    "and resource utilization to evaluate the system's efficiency. For example, in\n",

    "\n",
    "Every machine learning problem has a few key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The model itself, meaning choosing a hypothesis space and a learning\n",
    "    algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    h \\in \\mathcal{H} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathcal{A}\n",

    "\n",
    "-   The objective function, which is a function that measures how well the model\n",

    "    $$\n",

    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where $\\mathcal{S}$ is the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining the loss/cost/objective is quite straightforward. We try the most\n",
    "common ones first (RMSE, MAE, Cross-Entropy, etc.) and if the need arises,\n",
    "design your own objective function (i.e. Focal Loss). The ease of choosing a\n",
    "loss function is because there are already many common and well defined loss\n",

    "#### Decoupling Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have an example from chapter 2 of Chip's book _Design Machine Learning\n",

    "problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:example} Ranking items on a newsfeed\n",
    ":label: ml-lifecycle-02-ranking-items-newsfeed\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ranking items on a newsfeed\" means determining the order in which items such as\n",
    "posts, articles, or other types of content appear on a social media or news\n",
    "platform's feed. The goal of ranking is typically to prioritize content that is\n",
    "most likely to be of interest to the user and encourage engagement with that\n",
    "content.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a social media platform like Facebook or Instagram. When\n",
    "you open the app, you are presented with a feed of posts from your friends and\n",
    "accounts you follow. The order in which these posts appear on your feed is\n",
    "determined by a ranking algorithm, which takes into account a variety of factors\n",
    "to determine which posts are most likely to be relevant and engaging to you.\n",
    "These factors may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The recency of the post\n",
    "-   The relevance of the post to your interests, based on past behavior such as\n",
    "    likes and comments\n",
    "-   The engagement level of the post, such as the number of likes, comments, or\n",
    "    shares it has received\n",
    "-   The identity of the poster, such as whether the post is from a close friend\n",
    "    or family member\n",
    "-   The ranking algorithm uses these factors, and potentially many more, to\n",
    "    determine the order in which posts appear on your feed. The goal is to show\n",
    "    you the most interesting and engaging content at the top of your feed, while\n",
    "    filtering out irrelevant or unwanted content.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, you are tasked with building a machine learning system that\n",
    "ranks items on a newsfeed in a way that maximizes user engagement. To accomplish\n",
    "this goal, you have identified three key objectives that the system needs to\n",
    "optimize:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filter out spam: The system should be able to identify and filter out\n",
    "   irrelevant or unwanted content that is considered spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Filter out NSFW content: The system should be able to identify and filter out\n",
    "   content that is not safe for work (NSFW), such as explicit or offensive\n",
    "   material.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rank posts by engagement: The system should be able to predict how likely\n",
    "   users are to engage with each post, such as by clicking on it, sharing it, or\n",
    "   commenting on it. The system can then use this information to rank the posts\n",
    "   in order of predicted engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "By achieving these objectives, the system can create a more engaging and\n",
    "personalized newsfeed for users, while also filtering out unwanted content. Now,\n",
    "what's the problem here?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you quickly learned that optimizing for users’ engagement alone can\n",
    "lead to questionable ethical concerns. Because extreme posts tend to get more\n",
    "engagements, your algorithm learned to prioritize extreme content. You want to\n",
    "create a more wholesome newsfeed[^chip-1].\n",
    "\n",
    "With more power comes more responsibility. Ethical concern is also a very\n",
    "important aspect of making Machine Learning more mainstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we have a new goal, described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a \"new Goal\" **Maximize** users’ engagement while **minimizing** the spread\n",
    "of extreme views and misinformation\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain this goal, you add two new objectives to your original plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Filter out spam\n",
    "-   Filter out NSFW content\n",
    "-   **Filter out misinformation**\n",
    "-   **Rank posts by quality**\n",
    "-   Rank posts by engagement: how likely users will click on it\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the objectives are **conflicting** sometimes. For example,\n",
    "if a post carries radical views but is also very engaging (many users click on\n",
    "it), then should the system filter it out or rank it higher for users?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve this problem by decoupling the objectives. This means that we can\n",
    "optimize multiple objectives at the same time. This usually requires you to\n",
    "design your own loss function. For example if you want to optimize two\n",
    "objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   This usually requires you to design your own loss function. For example if\n",
    "    you want to optimize two objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",

    "    \\mathcal{L} &= \\alpha \\mathcal{L}_1 + \\beta \\mathcal{L}_2 \\\\\n",

    "    \\end{aligned}\n",
    "    $$\n",

    "[Pareto Optimality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) to\n",
    "understand more on how to tune the hyperparameters systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also train 2 models, one for each objective, and then combine the\n",
    "predictions of the two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model 1 ($h_1$): Minimizes the `quality_loss` and predicts the quality of the\n",
    "   post.\n",
    "2. Model 2 ($h_2$): Minimizes the `engagement_loss` and predicts the engagement\n",
    "   of the post (number of clicks for each post).\n",

    "and audio data are combined to better understand user sentiment. Textual data\n",
    "might be user reviews or comments, while audio data might include user\n",
    "recordings. The text and audio data are processed separately initially (i.e.,\n",
    "transformed into numerical form), and then concatenated to form a single input\n",
    "vector to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it naive? For one, the homogenization of features from vastly different\n",
    "modalities might lead to loss of information. Text is text data and tokenized,\n",
    "for audio data, it might be in the form of signals with temporal information.\n",
    "However, if you are able to extract features that are compatible across the\n",
    "different modalities, early fusion might be good - for example, converting audio\n",
    "data into spectrograms and then concatenating them with text data, or better,\n",
    "using speech-to-text to convert audio data into text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Late Fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Late fusion trains individual models on each data modality, later combining\n",
    "their outputs for the final decision. For example medical diagnosis of cancer\n",
    "might have image data passing through a typical Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "(CNN) or Vision Transformer (ViT) and text data passing through a Encoder based\n",
    "model, numerical data like lab results etc could pass through a traditional\n",
    "machine learning model like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the concatenation happens maybe at the last layer, where the previous\n",
    "results across the three modalities are pooled (averaged, concatenated, etc) to\n",
    "make the final decision. This is better than concatenating at the input level as\n",
    "the models can learn the best representations (i.e. embeddings for each\n",
    "modality) for each modality and then combine them at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hybrid Fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid fusion combines the strengths of both early and late fusion. It involves\n",
    "fusing data both at the input level and at the model output level.\n",
    "\n",
    "A healthcare monitoring system could use hybrid fusion for patient monitoring.\n",
    "Here, data like heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature (numerical data)\n",
    "could be combined with data from a wearable device (like step count and sleep\n",
    "hours) and textual data from patient self-reports. Early fusion could be used to\n",
    "combine the numerical data and processed wearable device data, and separate\n",
    "models could be trained on this combined data and the textual data. Then, late\n",
    "fusion would combine the outputs of these models for final analysis and\n",
    "predictions. The rationale here is that certain features might be more\n",
    "interrelated (justifying early fusion), while others might have unique patterns\n",
    "that are best captured separately (justifying late fusion).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing the Right Fusion Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "How does one choose the right fusion strategy? Honestly, this is not a trivial\n",
    "matter and often requires experimentation. However, there are some factors to\n",
    "consider from the book\n",
    "[\"Machine Learning System Design Interview\"](https://bytebytego.com/intro/machine-learning-system-design-interview)\n",
    "by Ali Aminian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the **_nature of the data sources_** is important. If the data sources\n",
    "are homogeneous (e.g. of the same type), simpler fusion techniques like early\n",
    "fusion might suffice and simple average pooling might be enough. However, if the\n",
    "sources are heterogeneous (e.g. images and text), more complex fusion methods\n",
    "might be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, one might build a super good fusion model but if it is not able to\n",
    "serve due to it being computationally intensive, then it is not a good model to\n",
    "say, serve in real time. Of course, modern engineering methods like\n",
    "quantization, pruning, and distillation might help but it is something to\n",
    "consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, the fusion method must be easily interpretable (e.g. in medical\n",
    "applications). This might favor simpler, more transparent methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, at this stage, you likely have an idea of the business problem you want\n",
    "to solve. Consequently, it is not uncommon to start thinking about a Minimum\n",
    "Viable Product (MVP) that can be used to solve the problem. I won't go into\n",
    "details on the difference between a demo, a prototype, and an MVP, but the idea\n",
    "is to have a basic version of the product that can be shown as a proof of\n",
    "concept.\n",
