    "\n",
    "Both data models are valid, but the former helps target users who are looking\n",
    "for a car to buy, and the latter helps target users who are looking for a car to\n",

    "### Relational Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A relational model is a data model used to represent and manage data in\n",
    "relational databases. It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd in 1970 and has\n",
    "since become the foundation for most modern database management systems. The\n",
    "relational model organizes data into tables, also known as relations, which\n",
    "consist of rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each table represents an entity (e.g., a person, a product, or an order), and\n",
    "each row in the table represents an instance or record of that entity. The\n",
    "columns define the attributes or properties of the entity, such as name, age, or\n",
    "price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relational model emphasizes the importance of relationships between tables,\n",
    "which are established using primary and foreign keys. A primary key is a unique\n",
    "identifier for each record within a table, while a foreign key is an attribute\n",
    "in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. These keys enable\n",
    "efficient querying and manipulation of data across multiple tables, allowing for\n",
    "complex data retrieval and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key features of the relational model include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Data integrity: The relational model enforces rules and constraints to\n",
    "    maintain the accuracy and consistency of data within the database.\n",
    "-   Normalization: Data is organized in a way that minimizes redundancy and\n",
    "    ensures efficient storage and retrieval.\n",
    "-   ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties: Relational\n",
    "    databases guarantee transactional integrity, ensuring that data remains\n",
    "    consistent and stable even in the event of failures or concurrent access.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with\n",
    "relational databases, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data\n",
    "within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Chip also mentioned that relational models are just a table with rows as tuples,\n",
    "where tuples hold the record of each row. Relations can be unordered and thus\n",
    "shuffling either the rows or the columns doesn't change the meaning of the data.\n",
    "CSV and Parquet are both relational models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The author mentioned that it is desirable for relations to be\n",
    "[**normalized**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization). We quote\n",
    "a clear example on what it means for normalization and how it reduces data\n",
    "redundancy and improve on data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:example} Normalization\n",
    ":label: ml-lifecycle-032-normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the relation Book shown in Table 3-2. There are a lot of duplicates in\n",
    "this data. For example, rows 1 and 2 are nearly identical, except for format and\n",
    "price. If the publisher information changes-for example, its name changes from\n",
    "\"Banana Press\" to \"Pineapple Press\"-or its country changes, we'll have to update\n",
    "rows 1, 2, and 4. If we separate publisher information into its own table, as\n",
    "shown in Tables 3-3 and 3-4, when a publisher's information changes, we only\n",
    "have to update the Publisher relation. This practice allows us to standardize\n",
    "spelling of the same value across different columns. It also makes it easier to\n",
    "make changes to these values, either because these values change or when you\n",
    "want to translate them into different languages.\n",

    "#### Imperative vs Declarative\n",
    "\n",
    "Imperative programming is when you tell the computer what to do step by step and\n",
    "it executes it to get the output. Declarative programming is when you tell the\n",
    "computer what you want and it figures out how to get it. Relational databases\n",
    "are declarative while languages such as Python are imperative.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is inherently declarative. When you write an SQL query, you specify _what_\n",
    "result you want, not _how_ to achieve it. The database engine decides the best\n",
    "way to execute the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, age FROM Users WHERE age > 30 ORDER BY age DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to implement the same functionality imperatively, as you might in\n",
    "Python, you would need to write detailed instructions to specify how to filter\n",
    "and sort the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import List, Dict, Union\n",
    "\n",
    "users = [{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 31}, {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}, {\"name\": \"Carol\", \"age\": 34}]\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_sorted_users_by_age(users: List[Dict[str, Union[str, int]]]) -> List[Dict[str, Union[str, int]]]:\n",
    "    filtered_users = [user for user in users if user[\"age\"] > 30]\n",
    "    sorted_users = sorted(filtered_users, key=lambda x: x[\"age\"], reverse=True)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reason that calls for the need for NoSQL databases is due to\n",
    "relational databases' strict schema enforcement and is a major pain point for\n",
    "many applications. On the other hand, NoSQL databases generally do not enforce a\n",
    "fixed schema, which means the data structure can evolve as the application's\n",
    "requirements change. This flexibility is particularly useful for handling\n",
    "unstructured or semi-structured data, such as text, multimedia, or JSON\n",
    "documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Document Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The document model is a part of NoSQL databases. NoSQL databases encompass\n",
    "various data models, including document, graph, key-value, and column-family\n",
    "stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The document model is one such NoSQL data model where data is stored as\n",
    "documents, usually in formats like JSON, XML, or BSON (Binary JSON). The\n",
    "document model provides a flexible and schema-less structure, making it easier\n",
    "to handle diverse or changing data requirements. This flexibility, along with\n",
    "better locality, makes the document model a popular choice for many\n",
    "applications. However, it may not be the best fit for every use case, as\n",
    "performing complex joins or queries can be more difficult and less efficient\n",
    "compared to relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the document model is a part of NoSQL databases, which provide\n",
    "alternative data models to address specific needs not effectively met by\n",
    "traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{list-table} Document Model Characteristics\n",
    ":header-rows: 0\n",
    ":name: ml-lifecycle-032-document-model\n",
    "\n",
    "-   -   Built around the concept of \"document\"\n",
    "-   -   Documents encoded in formats like JSON, XML, or BSON\n",
    "-   -   Unique key represents each document\n",
    "-   -   Collections of documents analogous to tables in relational databases\n",
    "-   -   Greater flexibility as documents in the same collection can have\n",
    "        different schemas\n",
    "-   -   Better locality than the relational model because all information about\n",
    "        a document is stored within a single document, where in a relational\n",
    "        model, you might need to perform joins across multiple tables to gather\n",
    "        all the information related to a document.\n",
    "```\n",

    "##### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the tables {numref}`ml-lifecycle-032-updated-book-relation` and\n",
    "{numref}`ml-lifecycle-032-publisher-relation`, we can now convert them into\n",
    "three JSON documents as show below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document 1: Title of Harry Potter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python title=\"Document 1: harry_potter.json\"\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"Title\": \"Harry Potter\",\n",
    "        \"Author\": \"J.K. Rowling\",\n",
    "        \"Publisher\": \"Banana Press\",\n",
    "        \"Country\": \"UK\",\n",
    "        \"SoldAs\": [\n",
    "            {\"Format\": \"Paperback\", \"Price\": \"$20\"},\n",
    "            {\"Format\": \"E-book\", \"Price\": \"$10\"},\n",
    "        ],\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Document 2: Title of Sherlock Holmes.\n",
    "\n",

    "    {\n",
    "        \"Title\": \"Sherlock Holmes\",\n",

    "            {\"Format\": \"Paperback\", \"Price\": \"$30\"},\n",
    "            {\"Format\": \"E-book\", \"Price\": \"$15\"},\n",
    "        ],\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Document 3: Title of The Hobbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python title=\"Document 3: the_hobbit.json\"\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"Title\": \"The Hobbit\",\n",
    "        \"Author\": \"J.R.R. Tolkien\",\n",
    "        \"Publisher\": \"Banana Press\",\n",
    "        \"Country\": \"UK\",\n",
    "        \"SoldAs\": [{\"Format\": \"Paperback\", \"Price\": \"$30\"}],\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "This format, which represents the data as JSON documents in a document model,\n",
    "can be better for certain use cases due to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flexibility**: Unlike relational databases, the document model allows each\n",
    "   document to have a different schema. This means that you can store different\n",
    "   attributes for each book without having to modify the structure of the entire\n",
    "   database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Better locality**: In the document model, all information about a book is\n",
    "   stored within a single document, making it easier to retrieve. In a\n",
    "   relational model, you might need to perform joins across multiple tables to\n",
    "   gather all the information related to a book, which can be more\n",
    "   time-consuming and computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Schema-less**: Although the term \"schema-less\" can be misleading, it\n",
    "   signifies that document databases do not enforce a strict schema like\n",
    "   relational databases. This allows for more flexibility when dealing with data\n",
    "   that does not fit neatly into predefined structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "In the document model, to find all books with prices below $25, you would have\n",
    "to iterate through each document, examine the `SoldAs` array, and compare the\n",
    "prices to $25. If the price is below $25, you can return or store the document\n",
    "for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be less efficient compared to using a relational model, where\n",
    "you can use a simple SQL query with a WHERE clause to filter the books based on\n",
    "the price condition. The SQL query would be more concise and potentially more\n",
    "efficient in terms of execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the trade-offs between the document and relational models depend on the\n",
    "specific use case and data requirements. The document model can be more suitable\n",
    "for applications that require flexibility, better locality, and do not\n",
    "frequently perform complex joins. On the other hand, a relational model can be\n",
    "more appropriate for applications that rely heavily on structured data and\n",
    "require the ability to perform complex queries and joins efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph model is another type of NoSQL data model that is specifically\n",
    "designed for handling highly interconnected data. In this model, data is\n",
    "represented as nodes (or vertices) and edges, where nodes represent entities and\n",
    "edges represent the relationships between those entities. Graph databases can\n",
    "efficiently model complex relationships and perform traversals, making them\n",
    "ideal for use cases where relationships between data items are common and\n",
    "important.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all the hype of vector databases nowadays, we see graph databases such as\n",
    "Neo4j to resurface as a popular choice for handling highly interconnected data\n",
    "and build knowledge graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key features of graph databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nodes**: Nodes are the primary entities in a graph database, representing\n",
    "   objects such as people, products, or locations. Each node can have\n",
    "   properties, which are key-value pairs that provide additional information\n",
    "   about the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edges**: Edges (or relationships) are the connections between nodes,\n",
    "   representing various types of relationships between entities. Edges can also\n",
    "   have properties, allowing for the storage of additional information about the\n",
    "   relationship, such as weights or timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Graph traversal**: One of the main strengths of graph databases is their\n",
    "   ability to efficiently perform graph traversal operations. This allows for\n",
    "   queries that involve multiple levels of relationships, such as finding the\n",
    "   shortest path between two nodes or identifying all nodes within a certain\n",
    "   distance of a specific node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Index-free adjacency**: Graph databases use index-free adjacency, meaning\n",
    "   that each node directly references its adjacent nodes. This allows for faster\n",
    "   traversal operations, as there is no need to perform expensive index lookups\n",
    "   to find related nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Schema flexibility**: Like other NoSQL databases, graph databases generally\n",
    "   offer more flexibility in terms of schema compared to relational databases.\n",
    "   This makes it easier to adapt to changing data requirements or evolving\n",
    "   relationships between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common use cases for graph databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Social networks: Graph databases can efficiently model the relationships\n",
    "    between users, such as friends, followers, or interests.\n",
    "-   Recommendation systems: By modeling user preferences and item relationships,\n",
    "    graph databases can be used to generate personalized recommendations.\n",
    "-   Fraud detection: By analyzing relationships and patterns within\n",
    "    transactional data, graph databases can help identify suspicious activity.\n",
    "-   Knowledge graphs: Graph databases can represent and store complex\n",
    "    relationships between entities in a knowledge domain, making it easier to\n",
    "    perform advanced queries and infer new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from this example could potentially come from a simple social network.\n",
    "In this graph, nodes can be of different data types: person, city, country,\n",
    "company, etc. Imagine you want to find everyone who was born in the USA. Given\n",
    "this graph, you can start from the node USA and traverse the graph following the\n",
    "edges “within” and “born_in” to find all the nodes of the type “person.” Now,\n",
    "imagine that instead of using the graph model to represent this data, we use the\n",
    "relational model. There’d be no easy way to write an SQL query to find everyone\n",

    "### Structured vs Unstructured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured data follows a predefined data model (data schema) and unstructured\n",
    "data does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Structured data is easier to query and analyze because you predefine the\n",
    "    data schema.\n",
    "-   For example, if your data model has two column, `name` and `age`, where\n",
    "    `name` is a string not longer than 100 characters and `age` is an integer\n",
    "    between 0 and 120, then you can safely average the `age` column without\n",
    "    worrying about if `age` is a string.\n",
    "-   The downside is now you are committed to this schema, so if you want to\n",
    "    change or add new stuff, you have to **retrospecitively** update all your\n",
    "    past data, causing errors and inconsistencies in the process.\n",
    "-   Unstructured data on the other hand can be anything. For example, the logs\n",
    "    of your model is a text containing a lot of information, and it is\n",
    "    unstructured. Another example is the medical report of a CT scan of\n",
    "    patients, which consists of a lot of images and text written by doctors.\n",
    "    Those are unstructured data.\n",
    "-   One distinction is for structured data, the code that **writes** the data\n",
    "    into the database has to adhere to the schema structure, while for\n",
    "    unstructured data, the code that **reads** the data from the database has to\n",
    "    adhere to the schema structure[^chip-1]. Writing unstructured data is easy,\n",
    "    but when reading you must be very sure of what the data structure is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data warehouse is a collection of structured data, while data lake is a\n",
    "collection of unstructured data. Data lakes are usually used to store raw data\n",
    "prior to being processed by data pipelines. Data warehouses are usually used to\n",
    "store processed data for analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Transactional And Analytical Processing Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of transactional and analytical processing databases is hazy to\n",
    "those who are not familiar with the underlying concept of data storage engines.\n",
    "As someone who is not familiar with the concept, one might wonder what's the\n",
    "difference between the two - for example, if I tell you that PostgreSQL is a\n",
    "transactional processing database, and Amazon Redshift is an analytical\n",
    "processing database, what does that mean? Don't they both \"query\" data\n",
    "similarly? Let's again refer to Chip Huyen's book _Designing Machine Learning\n",
    "Systems_ for a clear explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transactional Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we understand the idea of transactional processing databases. One who\n",
    "might have done some API development might be familiar with the concept of\n",
    "transactions through the lens of CRUD operations. For example, when a banking\n",
    "customer checks their balance, the operation involves a \"read\" transaction. This\n",
    "transaction interacts with the database to retrieve the requested information,\n",
    "such as the account balance. And for \"create\" transactions, when a customer\n",
    "transfers money from one account to another, the operation involves a \"write\"\n",
    "transaction. This transaction interacts with the database to update the account\n",
    "balances accordingly. This type of processing is what we call _online\n",
    "transaction processing_ (OLTP)[^chip-1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, transactional processing databases are designed to handle\n",
    "user-facing operations that require real-time responses and maintain the\n",
    "integrity of the data. These databases adhere to the ACID properties, which\n",
    "ensure that transactions satisfy crucial operational requirements such as _low\n",
    "latency_, _high availability_, and _data consistency_.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{list-table} ACID Properties\n",
    ":header-rows: 1\n",
    ":name: ml-lifecycle-032-acid-properties\n",
    "\n",
    "-   -   Property\n",
    "    -   Description\n",
    "-   -   Atomicity\n",
    "    -   Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work, either\n",
    "        fully completed or fully rolled back in case of failure. As an example,\n",
    "        if a user book an uber ride, we might trigger a single transaction but\n",
    "        involving several operations such as reading the user's account balance,\n",
    "        deducting the fare, and updating the account balance. If any of these\n",
    "        operations fail, the entire transaction fails. I mean if you read the\n",
    "        user's account balance and he has 0 dollars, yet you still deduct the\n",
    "        fare, that's a problem.\n",
    "-   -   Consistency\n",
    "    -   Ensures that the database remains in a consistent state before and after\n",
    "        the transaction, maintaining all predefined rules, such as data\n",
    "        integrity constraints and business rules. For example, in a bank, a\n",
    "        user's account must not go below zero after a transaction - the\n",
    "        no-overdraft rule.\n",
    "-   -   Isolation\n",
    "    -   Ensures that multiple transactions can run concurrently without\n",
    "        interfering with each other. For example, if two users try to book the\n",
    "        same uber ride at the same time, the system should ensure that each\n",
    "        user's transaction is isolated from the other, and not be assigned the\n",
    "        same driver.\n",
    "-   -   Durability\n",
    "    -   Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are\n",
    "        permanently stored and cannot be lost, even in the event of a system\n",
    "        failure. For example, if a user successfully books an uber ride, the\n",
    "        system must ensure that the booking is recorded and cannot be lost due\n",
    "        to a power outage or server crash.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transactional Databases Are Row-Major\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional transactional databases are row-major, meaning that they are\n",
    "optimized for reading and writing individual rows of data. This design is\n",
    "well-suited for handling OLTP workloads, where transactions typically involve\n",
    "small, granular operations on individual records. However, when it comes to\n",
    "analyzing large volumes of data or running complex queries that involve\n",
    "aggregations, joins, and filtering, row-major databases may not be the most\n",
    "efficient choice. For example, if you want to calculate the average age of all\n",
    "users in a database, a row-major database would need to scan through every row\n",
    "to compute the result, which can be slow and resource-intensive. This is where\n",
    "analytical processing databases come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical processing databases are designed to handle complex queries that\n",
    "involve aggregations, joins, and filtering on large datasets. These databases\n",
    "are usually multi-dimensional and are very efficient. We denote this type of\n",
    "processing as _online analytical processing_ (OLAP)[^chip-1].\n",
    "\n",
    "However, modern databases can handle both transactional and analytical workloads\n",
    "(i.e. CockroachDB, Amazon Iceberg, etc.).\n",

    "## Vector Database (A High-dimensional Playground for Large Language Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vector database** is like a database which is a data storage system that\n",
    "capitalizes on the properties of vectors embeddings. The high-dimensional\n",
    "vectors stored in these databases embody the features or attributes of data,\n",
    "which could range from text, images, audio, and video to even more complex\n",
    "structures. We can have additional metadata to describe the data, but the\n",
    "vectors are the main focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial task of converting raw data to their vector representations\n",
    "(embeddings) is typically achieved by utilizing machine learning models, word\n",
    "embedding algorithms, or feature extraction techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a movie review text can be represented as a high-dimensional\n",
    "vector via transformer based embedding models. Similarly, an image can be\n",
    "transformed into a vector representation using deep learning models like\n",
    "convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector databases deviate from the conventional way databases work. Rather than\n",
    "retrieving data based on exact matches or predefined criteria, vector databases\n",
    "empower users to conduct searches based on vector similarity. This facilitates\n",
    "the retrieval of data that bears semantic or contextual similarity to the query\n",
    "data, even if they don't share exact keyword matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this example: Given an image of a cat, a vector database can find\n",
    "images that are visually similar (e.g., other images of cats, or perhaps images\n",
    "of small, furry animals), even if \"cat\" isn't explicitly tagged or described in\n",
    "the metadata of those images via the vector representations.\n",
