    "## Data Engineering In Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine learning models** require require data. And from the GPT-2 paper named\n",
    "_Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners_, the authors mentioned\n",
    "that one major key to the success of their model is the **quantity** and\n",

    "\n",
    "They establish **[data pipelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_pipeline)**\n",
    "that automate the flow of data from source to destination, allowing for\n",

    "## A Naive DataOps Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we outline a very naive and simple workflow of a data\n",
    "engineering pipeline. This is meant to give you a high-level overview of the\n",
    "process, and by no means encapsulates the complexity of a real-world data\n",
    "engineering workflow. Things like big data paradigms like Hadoop, Spark, and\n",
    "distributed systems are not covered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataOps's iterative process consists of several stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Data Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection)**:\n",
    "   Identifying the relevant data sources and collecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Ingestion/Integration**: This stage consists of two major parts:\n",

    "    - **[Data Extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_extraction)**:\n",
    "      Extracting the collected data from various sources.\n",
    "    - **[Data Loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_loading)**: Loading\n",
    "      the extracted data into a centralized storage such as a data warehouse,\n",
    "      data lake, or lakehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **[Data Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation)**:\n",
    "   Transforming the data into a format suitable for downstream tasks. This stage\n",
    "   may include cleaning, aggregating, or restructuring the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Validation**: A crucial step to ensure the accuracy and quality of the\n",
    "   data. Validation techniques can be applied in parallel with the data\n",
    "   transformation stage or immediately after loading the raw data. By performing\n",

    "\n",
    "**Legends**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Staging: The staging environment is where the code is deployed for testing\n",
    "    purposes. It is a replica of the production environment where the code is\n",
    "    tested before it is deployed to production.\n",
    "-   Production: The production environment is where the code is deployed for\n",
    "    production use. It is the environment where the code is used by the end\n",
    "    users.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more environments in a typical software development lifecycle,\n",
    "like QA, UAT, etc. However, for the sake of simplicity, we will focus on the\n",
    "staging and production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1. Data Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Source data is identified and extracted from various internal and external\n",
    "    databases and APIs.\n",
    "-   Data is extracted using either full or incremental refreshes, depending on\n",
    "    the source system.\n",
    "-   The data can be extracted via pure code level such as using Python, or using\n",
    "    modern tech stacks such as Airbyte, FiveTran or orchestration tools such as\n",
    "    Airflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample python DAG for this step is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "from typing import Optional, Any\n",
    "\n",
    "class Config(BaseModel):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "class Logger(BaseModel):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "class Connection(BaseModel):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "class Metadata(BaseModel):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Extract:\n",
    "    def __init__(\n",
    "        self, cfg: Config, logger: Logger, connection: Connection, metadata: Metadata\n",
    "    ) -> None:\n",
    "        self.cfg = cfg\n",

    "        self.extract_from_connection()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `cfg`, `logger` and `metadata` are the configuration, logger and metadata\n",
    "    objects respectively.\n",
    "-   `connection` is the connection object that represents the data source. It\n",
    "    can be API, database, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2. Data Loading to Staging Lake\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we want to extract our data from a remote API and load it to a\n",
    "staging layer in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), where the GCS serves as the staging\n",
    "data lake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look a templated DAG for this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define a base class for the load process.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Validator(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def validate(self, data: Any) -> bool:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Validates the data. Returns True if valid, False otherwise.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class DVC(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def commit(self, message: str) -> None:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Commits the changes to the DVC repository.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Load(ABC):\n",
    "    def __init__(\n",

    "        cfg: Config,\n",
    "        logger: Logger,\n",
    "        metadata: Metadata,\n",
    "        dvc: Optional[DVC] = None,\n",
    "        validator: Optional[Validator] = None,\n",
    "    ) -> None:\n",
    "        self.cfg = cfg\n",
    "        self.logger = logger\n",
    "        self.metadata = metadata\n",
    "        self.dvc = dvc\n",
    "        self.validator = validator\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def load_to_staging(self) -> None:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Load data to staging.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def load_to_production(self) -> None:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Load data to production.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def run(self, is_staging: bool = True) -> None:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Run the load stage.\"\"\"\n",
    "        self.logger.info(\"Running load stage\")\n",

    "        self.logger.info(\"Load stage complete\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we define a class that inherits from the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LoadToLake(Load):\n",
    "    def load_to_staging(self) -> None:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Load data to staging.\"\"\"\n",
    "        self.logger.info(f\"Loading data to staging {self.cfg.staging_lake}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def load_to_production(self) -> None:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Load data to production.\"\"\"\n",
    "        self.logger.info(f\"Loading data to production {self.cfg.production_lake}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Extracted data from step 1 is loaded into a dedicated **staging** area\n",
    "    within [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage). This\n",
    "    process serves as the initial raw data checkpoint, providing an\n",
    "    **immutable** storage layer for unprocessed data. This approach to storing\n",
    "    raw data helps maintain data integrity throughout the pipeline.\n",
    "-   The data is stored in a structured format, for instance, in the form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    staging/raw_{table_name}/created_at={YYYY-MM-DD:HH:MM:SS:MS}`\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    where\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `staging` is the staging layer in GCS.\n",
    "    -   `raw_table_name` is the name of the table that you intend to store\n",
    "        later. Simply put, it is the name of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This structure allows for easy tracking of the data's origin and timestamp,\n",
    "    adhering to the common\n",
    "    **[partitioning scheme](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables)**\n",
    "    used in data storage. We can also add commit hash if need be, but as we\n",
    "    shall see shortly, if we have a versioning tool like DVC, we can use that to\n",
    "    maintain the data's lineage.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Even though the data is stored such that we can easily reference the data's\n",
    "    origin and timestamp, there is a need to maintain a detailed record of the\n",
    "    data's **lineage**. This is where the **metadata** comes in. The metadata\n",
    "    contains information such as the data's origin, timestamp, and other\n",
    "    essential details such as the data's schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Furthermore, modern data versioning tools such as\n",
    "    [DVC (Data Version Control)](https://dvc.org) can be used to maintain a\n",
    "    detailed record of the data's lineage, ensuring that changes to the data can\n",
    "    be tracked and managed in a reproducible manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the rationale in storing the data in GCS?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Raw Data Checkpoint**: GCS serves as a storage layer for raw, unprocessed\n",
    "    data. This creates a checkpoint where the data is unaltered and can be\n",
    "    reverted to if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Flexibility**: Storing data in GCS provides flexibility in data formats\n",
    "    and allows for decoupling of storage and compute. It can serve various\n",
    "    downstream applications that might require raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Cost-Effective**: GCS typically provides a more cost-effective solution\n",
    "    for storing large volumes of data, especially when long-term storage is\n",
    "    needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Immutable Storage Layer**: By providing an immutable storage layer, GCS\n",
    "    ensures that the original raw data remains unaltered, maintaining data\n",
    "    integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Interoperability**: GCS can serve multiple environments and tools, not\n",
    "    just BigQuery, so it's a general-purpose storage solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3. Loading Data to Staging Warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, once we have the data in the staging GCS, we can load it to staging\n",
    "BigQuery. This is done using the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LoadToWarehouse(Load):\n",
    "    def load_to_staging(self) -> None:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Load data to staging.\"\"\"\n",
    "        self.logger.info(f\"Loading data to staging {self.cfg.staging_warehouse}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def load_to_production(self) -> None:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Load data to production.\"\"\"\n",
    "        self.logger.info(f\"Loading data to production {self.cfg.production_warehouse}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The data in the staging GCS is loaded into Google BigQuery for more advanced\n",
    "    processing and analysis. We are assuming the data is structured and ready\n",
    "    for loading into BigQuery.\n",
    "-   Data can be loaded using both write and append modes, allowing for\n",
    "    incremental refreshes.\n",
    "-   Metadata such as `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps are added to\n",
    "    maintain a detailed record of the data's lineage.\n",
    "-   As BigQuery's primary key system may have limitations, one needs to be\n",
    "    careful to ensure that there are no **duplicate** records in the data.\n",
    "-   The path name of the data in GCS is used as the table name in BigQuery. For\n",
    "    instance, if the data is stored in the following path:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    staging/raw_{table_name}/created_at={YYYY-MM-DD:HH:MM:SS:MS}`\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    then the table name in BigQuery will be `staging/raw_{table_name}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the rationale in storing the data in BigQuery, the staging analytics\n",
    "layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Advanced Processing & Analysis**: BigQuery is designed for performing\n",
    "    complex queries and analytics. Loading data into BigQuery allows you to\n",
    "    leverage its full analytical capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Optimized Query Performance**: BigQuery provides optimized query\n",
    "    performance, making it suitable for interactive and ad-hoc queries,\n",
    "    dashboards, and reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4. Data Validation After Extraction and Load\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Once the data is extracted and loaded into the staging area in GCS or\n",
    "    BigQuery, a preliminary data validation process is conducted.\n",
    "-   This may include checking for the presence and correctness of key fields,\n",
    "    ensuring the right data types, checking data ranges, verifying data\n",
    "    integrity, and so on.\n",
    "-   If the data fails the validation, appropriate error handling procedures\n",
    "    should be implemented. This may include logging the error, sending an alert,\n",
    "    or even stopping the pipeline based on the severity of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall earlier in our `Load` base class, there is a `validator` in the\n",
    "constructor? This is where we can specify the validator to use for the data\n",
    "validation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a validation interface (an abstract class in Python) that will\n",
    "enforce the structure of all validators.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Validator(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def validate(self, data: Any) -> bool:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Validates the data. Returns True if valid, False otherwise.\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we implement our own validator by inheriting from the `Validator`\n",
    "interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MySpecificValidator(Validator):\n",
    "    def validate(self, data: Any) -> bool:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Add logic here to check data's correctness, data types, etc.\"\"\"\n",
    "        return is_valid\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the `Load` class, you can call the `validate` method of the provided\n",
    "`validator` instance at the appropriate stage of loading. Here's an example that\n",
    "adds a validation step after loading to staging:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Load(ABC):\n",
    "    def load_to_staging(self) -> None:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Load data to staging.\"\"\"\n",
    "        # Loading logic here...\n",
    "        self.logger.info(f\"Loading data to staging {self.cfg.staging_dir}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Validate the data\n",
    "        if self.validator:\n",
    "            is_valid = self.validator.validate(data) # assuming data is what you want to validate\n",
    "            if not is_valid:\n",
    "                self.logger.error(\"Validation failed for staging data\")\n",
    "                # Additional error handling logic like raise etc.\n",
    "                return\n",
    "\n",
    "        self.logger.info(\"Load stage to staging complete\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common in the industry to see a hybrid approach where basic validation is\n",
    "performed at the staging lake layer (GCS), followed by more validation once the\n",
    "data is loaded into staging warehouse layer (BigQuery). For example, some\n",
    "obvious bad data can be filtered out at the GCS layer, while more complex and\n",
    "specific validation can be done at the BigQuery layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5. Data Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In this step, the raw data from the staging area undergoes a series of\n",
    "    transformation processes to be refined into a format suitable for downstream\n",
    "    use cases, including analysis and machine learning model training. These\n",
    "    transformations might involve operations such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and correcting (or removing) errors and\n",
    "        inconsistencies in the data. This might include handling missing values,\n",

    "    carried out on the transformed data.\n",
    "-   This may involve checking the output of the transformation against expected\n",
    "    results, ensuring the data structure conforms to the target schema, and\n",
    "    performing statistical checks (e.g., distributions, correlations, etc.).\n",
    "-   If the transformed data fails the validation, appropriate steps are taken\n",
    "    just like after extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, we should already be able to tell that the data validation process is an\n",
    "integral part of the data pipeline. It's not just a one-time check at the\n",
    "beginning of the pipeline, but rather a continuous process that occurs at\n",
    "multiple stages throughout the pipeline. Phew, so much work!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7. Load Transformed Data to Staging GCS and BigQuery\n",
    "\n",
    "-   After the data transformation and validation, the resulting data is loaded\n",
    "    back into the staging environment. This involves both Google Cloud Storage\n",
    "    (GCS) and BigQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Staging GCS**: The transformed data is saved back into a specific\n",
    "        location in the staging GCS. This provides a backup of the transformed\n",
    "        data and serves as an intermediate checkpoint before moving the data to\n",
    "        the production layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Staging BigQuery**: The transformed data is also loaded into a\n",
    "        specific table in the staging area in BigQuery. Loading the transformed\n",
    "        data into BigQuery allows for quick and easy analysis and validation of\n",
    "        the transformed data, thanks to BigQuery's capabilities for handling\n",
    "        large-scale data and performing fast SQL-like queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   This step of loading the transformed data back into the staging GCS and\n",
    "    BigQuery is very similar to the earlier loading step. The `Load` class can\n",
    "    be reused for this step as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 8. (Optional) Writing a DAG to Automate the Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The whole step from 1 to 7 can be wrapped in a DAG.\n",
    "-   This means you can use things like Airflow to orchestrate the whole process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can automate the code without a DAG as well, so why DAG? Here's some reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{list-table} Why DAG?\n",
    ":header-rows: 1\n",
    ":widths: 25 75\n",

    "\n",
    "-   -   Feature\n",
    "    -   Description\n",
    "-   -   Scheduling and Automation\n",
    "    -   Airflow provides built-in scheduling options. You can define complex\n",
    "        schedules in a standard way, allowing tasks to be run at regular\n",
    "        intervals, on specific dates, or in response to specific triggers.\n",
    "        Managing scheduling in a custom Python script can be more\n",
    "        labor-intensive and error-prone.\n",
    "-   -   Parallel Execution and Resource Management\n",
    "    -   Airflow allows for parallel execution of tasks that don't depend on each\n",
    "        other. It can efficiently manage resources and distribute tasks across\n",
    "        different workers, something that can be complex and time-consuming to\n",
    "        implement in a custom Python pipeline.\n",
    "-   -   Monitoring and Logging\n",
    "    -   Airflow provides a user-friendly web interface that includes detailed\n",
    "        logs, visualizations of DAG runs, task status information, and more.\n",
    "        Building such comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities into a\n",
    "        custom Python pipeline would require significant development effort.\n",
    "-   -   Error Handling and Retries\n",
    "    -   Airflow offers standard mechanisms for handling task failures, including\n",
    "        retries with backoff, notifications, etc. Implementing similar robust\n",
    "        error handling in a custom Python pipeline might require substantial\n",
    "        work.\n",
    "-   -   Integration with Various Tools\n",
    "    -   Airflow has a rich ecosystem of operators that facilitate integration\n",
    "        with various data sources, platforms, and tools. Implementing such\n",
    "        integrations manually in a custom Python script can be time-consuming\n",
    "        and less flexible.\n",
    "-   -   Scalability\n",
    "    -   Airflow is designed to run on distributed systems, making it easier to\n",
    "        scale up as data and processing requirements grow. Building scalability\n",
    "        into a custom Python pipeline might require extensive architectural\n",
    "        changes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Airflow however is a complex tool, and if the use case is simple, it might be\n",
    "overkill - or one can argue if use case is simple, then the underlying DAG might\n",
    "be simple as well. One key thing of Airflow is the observability and monitoring\n",
    "capabilities it provides, which is crucial. Imagine a cronjob failing and you\n",
    "have no idea why, and you have to dig through logs to find out what happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 9. Containerize the DAG\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Feedback Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "This refers to insights from monitoring and any errors encountered in production\n",
    "are fed back into the development process, leading to new iterations of\n",
    "development, testing, and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the movement of data from the staging layer to the production layer\n",
    "happens once the data has been cleaned, transformed, validated, and is deemed\n",
    "ready for use in downstream applications such as machine learning model\n",
    "training, analytics, reporting, etc. The transformed data is first validated to\n",
    "ensure that it meets the required quality standards. If the validation is\n",
    "successful, the data is moved to the production layer. The goal is to only\n",
    "expose clean, validated, and reliable data to end users or downstream\n",
    "applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data has passed both rounds of validation, it can be loaded into the\n",
    "production layer in both GCS and BigQuery. At this point, the data is ready for\n",
    "downstream use in tasks such as model training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of ML, these steps form the beginning part of our pipeline, where\n",
    "data is extracted, cleaned, and made ready for use in our ML models. Each step\n",
    "is designed to ensure the integrity and usability of the data, from extraction\n",
    "to querying for model training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, this is highly simplified and the actual process can be much more\n",
    "complex. For example, we simply assumed GCS and BigQuery, but in reality, you\n",
    "might have multiple data sources and destinations and even multiple data lakes\n",
    "and warehouses. The key is to understand the principles and adapt them to your\n",
    "needs.\n",
