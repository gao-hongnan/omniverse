    "In this code, we're using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to generate and visualize samples from a mixture of two Gaussian distributions. The purpose of the visualization is to demonstrate how the GMM can approximate the true underlying distribution as the number of samples increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We define sample_sizes as a list containing the number of samples to generate for each subplot (100, 500, and 10000).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We create a 2x2 grid of subplots with shared x and y axes, with a figure size of 12x10.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We plot the mixture PDF on the first subplot (axes[0]). This represents the true underlying distribution that we are trying to approximate with our GMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We iterate over the sample_sizes list, and for each sample size, we use the generate_x function to generate samples from the GMM. The generate_x function takes the prior probabilities, the means and standard deviations of the Gaussians, the number of samples, and the number of Gaussians as input arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For each sample size, we plot a histogram of the generated samples on the corresponding subplot. We normalize the histogram to match the density of the true underlying distribution. We also plot the mixture PDF on the same subplot to compare the generated samples with the true distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We set the titles, x-axis labels, and y-axis labels for all subplots, and add a legend to each subplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. We use plt.tight_layout() to adjust the spacing between subplots, and finally display the figure using plt.show().\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of GMM, this code demonstrates how the GMM can be used to generate samples from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The generated samples are visualized as histograms, which are compared to the true underlying distribution (the mixture PDF) to show how well the GMM approximates the true distribution. As the number of samples increases, the histograms of the generated samples become closer to the mixture PDF, indicating that the GMM is effectively approximating the true distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note carefully again that this is under the assumption that we already know the parameters of the mixture model, which is not the case in machine learning. In machine learning, we are interested in the \"inference\" side, which is to infer the parameters of the mixture model from the dataset $\\mathcal{S}$!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference Story\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's flip the table and see how we can infer the parameters of the mixture model from the dataset $\\mathcal{S}$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Import necessary libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, and GaussianMixture from scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate a synthetic dataset with three clusters:\n",
    "   - Set a random seed to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "   - Define the number of samples (500).\n",

While hard clustering methods assign a given data point to precisely one cluster, soft clustering methods typically assign a data point to several different clusters with non-zero degree of belonging {cite}`jung_2023`.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two interpretations of the Gaussian mixture model: the latent variable perspective and the data likelihood perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Mixture Model Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixture model perspective: In this perspective, GMM is seen as a simple mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions. The goal is to model the probability density function (PDF) of the observed data as a weighted sum of the individual Gaussian PDFs. Each Gaussian component has its own mean and covariance matrix, and the model learns the weights, means, and covariances that best fit the data. This perspective focuses on the density estimation aspect of GMM and is less concerned with the underlying latent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Latent Variable Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent variable perspective: In this perspective, GMM is viewed as a generative probabilistic model that assumes there are some hidden (latent) variables responsible for generating the observed data points. Each hidden variable corresponds to one of the Gaussian components in the mixture. The data points are assumed to be generated by first sampling the latent variable (component) from a categorical distribution and then sampling the data point from the corresponding Gaussian distribution. This perspective is closely related to the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which alternates between estimating the component assignments (latent variables) and updating the Gaussian parameters (mean, covariance) to maximize the likelihood of the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Both perspectives ultimately lead to the same model, but they highlight different aspects of GMM and can be useful in different contexts. For example, the latent variable perspective is more suitable for clustering and classification tasks, while the mixture model perspective is more useful for density estimation and generating new samples from the modeled distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few sections, we will discuss the latent variable perspective, but note there\n",
    "may be some mix of the two perspectives in the following sections. For example,\n",

    "## Why GMM has no Closed-Form Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We have emphasized along the way that the estimation of the parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model is a difficult problem and has no closed-form solution. However, it may be\n",
    "confusing to one why this is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we seemingly have found estimates for the mean, covariance, and mixture weights of the GMM in the previous 3 sections, why is it that we cannot find a closed-form solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, there is some intricacy to this question. First, we clear the confusiong:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the context of Gaussian Mixture Models, a closed-form solution refers to a single expression that can simultaneously provide the optimal values of all the parameters without any iterative steps or dependencies between the parameters. However, in the case of GMM, the responsibilities, which are crucial for updating the parameters, depend on the parameters themselves in a complex manner (more on this in Bishop's book).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Although we can optimally update each of the parameters **given** the other parameters, we cannot compute all the parameters at once because of their interdependence. What does this mean? This means when we update the means, we need to know the responsibilities, which depend on the means. However, when we update the responsibilities, we need to know the means, which depend on the responsibilities. This is a circular dependency, which means we cannot simultaneously update the means and the responsibilities (easily).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Moreover, when we update the covariance matrices, we need to know **both** the means and the responsibilities! Again, ***simultaneous*** updates of the means, responsibilities, and covariance matrices are not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, when we update the mixture weights, we need to know **all** the parameters, including the means, responsibilities, and covariance matrices. Again, ***simultaneous*** updates of all the parameters are not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the reason we can \"find the estimates\" just now is because we are not\n",
    "simultaneously finding the optimal values of all the parameters. Instead, we are finding the optimal values of the parameters **given** the other parameters. This is a very important distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation is similar to hard clustering in K-Means, where the ultimate goal is to jointly optimize cluster means and assignments, which is a NP-hard problem. However, we can optimize the cluster means **given** the cluster assignments, and then optimize the cluster assignments **given** the cluster means. This is a two-step process, which is not a closed-form solution, but gives local optima for each step. The same is true for GMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interesting result gives rise to iterative methods like [Expectation-Maximization (EM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to introduce the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which is a popular algorithm for estimating the parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it stands, we will start by introducing the EM algorithm in the context of Gaussian Mixture Models. This is an slightly more *informal* treatment of the EM algorithm, which is meant to give you a general idea of how the algorithm works.\n",

    "Unfortunately, the updates in {eq}`eq:gmm-update-means-1`, {eq}`eq:gmm-update-covariance-1`, and {eq}`eq:gmm-update-mixture-weights-1` do not constitute a closed-form solution for the updates of the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{k}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{k}, \\pi_{k}$ of the mixture model because the responsibilities $r^{(n)}_{k}$ depend on those parameters in a complex way. However, the results suggest a simple iterative scheme for finding a solution to the parameters estimation problem via maximum likelihood. The expectation maximization algorithm was proposed by Dempster et al. (1977) and is a general iterative scheme for learning parameters (maximum likelihood or MAP) in mixture models and, more generally, latent-variable models.\n",

As also nicely described by MacKay (2003), $K$-means makes a \"hard\" assignment of data points to cluster centers $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{k}$, whereas a GMM makes a \"soft\" assignment via the responsibilities.\n",
