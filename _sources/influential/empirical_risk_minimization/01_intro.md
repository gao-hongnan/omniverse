# Empirical Risk Minimization

This chapter talks about the
[Empirical Risk Minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization)
(ERM) principle. This statistical learning theory defines a family of algorithms
that give theoretical bounds on their performance. The core idea is that we
cannot know exactly how well an algorithm will work in practice (the true
"risk") because we don't know the true distribution of data that the algorithm
will work on, but we can instead measure its performance on a known set of
training data (the "empirical" risk).
