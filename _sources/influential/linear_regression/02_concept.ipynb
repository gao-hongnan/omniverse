    "### Univariate Linear Model\n",

    "Let's try to model the relationship between the house size (sqft) and the price ($). The assumption of linearity means that the expected value of the target (price) can be expressed as a\n",
    "linear function of the feature (sqft).\n",

    "$$ (eq_price-area)\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\\beta_1$ the coefficient, $x$ the feature (sqft) and $y$ the target (price).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the coefficient $\\beta_1$ is called the *weights* and the intercept $\\beta_0$ is called the *bias*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights determine the influence of each feature on our prediction, this means that\n",
    "a larger weight indicates that the feature is more important for predicting the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias determines the value of the estimate when all features are zero. Why do we need this?\n",
    "Will there ever be a case where the house size (sqft) is $0$? No, but we still need the bias because it allows us\n",
    "to express the functional/hypothesis space of linear functions (more on that later). Intuitively,\n",

    "If there is no bias term in the model, you will lose the flexibility of your model. Imagine a simple linear regression model without a bias term, then your linear equation $y=mx$ will only pass through the origin. Therefore, if your underlying data (pretend that we know that the underlying data's actual function $y = 3x + 5$), then your Linear Regression model will never find the \"best fit line\" simply because we already assume that our prediction is governed by the slope $m$, and there does not exist our $c$, the intercept/bias term.\n",

We also note that $1$ unit increase in $x$ will correspond to a $\\beta_1$ unit increase in $y$ according to the model, while always remebering to add the intercept term.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a widely used metric for evaluating the performance of regression models. It represents the average of the squared differences between the actual values and the predicted values of the dependent variable. Lower MSE values indicate a better fit of the model, as the squared differences between the predicted and actual values are smaller on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MSE is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N}(y^{(n)} - \\hat{y}^{(n)})^2\n",
    "$$\n",

    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\text{MSE}$ is the Mean Squared Error,\n",

    "- $y^{(n)}$ is the actual value of the dependent variable for observation $n$,\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}^{(n)}$ is the predicted value of the dependent variable for observation $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE has several desirable properties as a loss function for regression tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is non-negative, meaning that it always returns a positive value, or zero when the predictions are perfect.\n",
    "2. It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors, as the differences between the predicted and actual values are squared. This makes the model more sensitive to outliers and encourages it to fit the data more closely.\n",
    "3. It is differentiable, which allows for the application of optimization techniques like gradient descent to find the best model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, MSE has some limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The squared differences can lead to overemphasis on outliers, which might not be desirable in some applications.\n",
    "2. The scale of MSE depends on the scale of the dependent variable, making it challenging to compare the performance of models with different output scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, other metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) can be used alongside MSE to better understand the model's performance and address its limitations.\n",

    "R-squared ($R^2$) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (response) that can be explained by the independent variables (predictors) in a linear regression model. It is a value between 0 and 1, and a higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model. The R-squared metric can be understood as the proportion of variation in the data that is accounted for by the fitted model.\n",

    "\n",
    "One should realize that $SS_{tot}$ refers to the total variation in the response variable, which can be\n",
    "thought of as the amount of variation inherently in the response before we fit the regression model.\n",
    "In constrast, $SS_{res}$ refers to the variation in the response variable that is left unexplained\n",
    "after fitting the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the definition of R-squared is fairly straight-forward; it is the percentage of the response variable variation that is explained by a linear model.\n",
    "In other words, R-squared is Explained variation / Total variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is always between 0 and 100% where\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.\n",
    "- 100% indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "As popular as it is, R-squared is not without its flaws.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every time you add a predictor to a model, the R-squared increases, even if due to chance alone. It never decreases. Consequently, a model with more terms may appear to have a better fit simply because it has more terms.\n",
    "2. If a model has too many predictors and higher order polynomials, it begins to model the random noise in the data. This condition is known as [overfitting the model](https://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics/the-danger-of-overfitting-regression-models) and it produces misleadingly high R-squared values and a lessened ability to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation of R-squared is that it can only increase, or stay the same, as you add more predictors to the model, even if those predictors are not truly improving the model's fit. This is why it's important to consider other metrics like adjusted R-squared, which penalizes the model for the inclusion of unnecessary predictors, or use other methods like cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjusted R-Squared\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the limitations of R-squared, we can use the adjusted R-squared metric, where\n",
    "it is a modification of the R-squared ($R^2$) metric that takes into account the number of predictors in a linear regression model. It adjusts the R-squared value to account for the addition of predictors, preventing the artificial inflation of the R-squared value when adding more predictors that may not necessarily improve the model's fit.\n",

    "\n",
    "This section is adapted from the blog post,\n",
    "[Linear Regression Assumptions by Jeff Macaluso](https://jeffmacaluso.github.io/post/LinearRegressionAssumptions/).\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is important for one to check the assumptions of linear regression, it is also\n",
    "important to know that we do not require them to *fit* the model. We only require them to *interpret* the model.\n",
    "The difference is subtle, but important. If you view the linear regression from the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) perspective,\n",
    "then the only assumption you need is for the matrix $\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}$ to be invertible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more rigorous treatment of the assumptions of linear regression, see [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/16381/what-is-a-complete-list-of-the-usual-assumptions-for-linear-regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes that there is a linear relationship between the predictors (e.g. independent variables or features) and the response variable (e.g. dependent variable or label). This also assumes that the predictors are additive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it can happen:** There may not just be a linear relationship among the data. Modeling is about trying to estimate a function that explains a process, and linear regression would not be a fitting estimator (pun intended) if there is no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it will affect:** The predictions will be extremely inaccurate because our model is [underfitting](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1125/1*_7OPgojau8hkiPUiHoGK_w.png). This is a serious violation that should not be ignored. However, do not forget we have learnt that we can model non-linear relationships using polynomial regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to detect it:** If there is only one predictor, this is pretty easy to test with a scatter plot. Most cases aren’t so simple, so we’ll have to modify this by using a scatter plot to see our predicted values versus the actual values (in other words, view the residuals). Ideally, the points should lie on or around a diagonal line on the scatter plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to fix it:** Either adding polynomial terms to some of the predictors or applying nonlinear transformations . If those do not work, try adding additional variables to help capture the relationship between the predictors and the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

Specifically, you can interpret a coefficient as “an increase of 1 in this predictor results in a change of (coefficient) in the response variable, holding all other predictors constant.” This becomes problematic when multicollinearity is present because we can’t hold correlated predictors constant.

    "### Standard Error\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here is the intuition, yet again, we need to gain an understanding first before we go into further mathematical details. We already established subtly that even if we can easily calculate $\\hat\\beta_1$, and it turns out to be non-zero, how can we feel **\"safe\"** that our true parameter $\\beta_1$ is also non-zero? Well if you think deeper, it all boils down to whether our $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ is a **good estimate** of $\\beta_1$; and this can be quantified by checking the standard error of $\\hat{\\beta_1}$. By definition, we should remember the standard error of $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ means the amount of dispersion of the various $\\hat\\beta_1$ around its mean (recall the mean of $\\hat\\beta_1$ is $\\beta_1$). So if $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})$ is small, this means $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ does not vary much around its mean and recall that the mean of $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ is none other than $\\beta_1$ due to the unbiasedness property of OLS estimator; consequently, it is quite \"safe\" to say that which ever sample you take from the population, the $\\hat\\beta_1$ you calculated should not fluctuate much from the mean $\\beta_1$, indicating that $\\beta_1$ and $\\hat\\beta_1$ are quite \"close to each other\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But here is the catch yet again, how small is small? If for example, $\\hat{\\beta_1} = 0.5$ but if $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = 0.499$, then this standard error is not small relative to the value of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$. $\\hat{\\beta_1}$. One should understand in a rough sense that the standard error of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ is the **average amount that this particular $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ differs from the actual value of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$.** So if for example, the above example says that the average amount that this $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ differs from the real $\\beta_1$ is 0.499, and this is not very promising because it means that our real $\\beta_1$ could be $0.5-0.499 = 0.001$, which is very close to $0$, we do not really feel safe about our $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ since it can still suggest that our real $\\beta_1$ is near 0 and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that $\\beta_1 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if our standard error of $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ is very large, say equals to 10000, this does not necessarily mean our $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ is an inaccurate estimate of $\\beta_1$, because if our $\\beta_1$ is so large relative to 10000, say our $\\beta_1 = 1000000000000$, then this standard error is small relatively and we still have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In a similar vein as the previous example, on average, we should expect our $\\beta_1$ to be around $1000000000000 \\pm 10000$, which is nowhere close to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we also must find a metric to calculate how small is small, or conversely, how big is big. Therefore, to understand that if $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1}) <<< \\hat{\\beta_1}$, that is, standard error of the estimator $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ is way smaller than $\\hat{\\beta_1}$, then it is safe to say that our $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ provides strong evidence that the real parameter is non-zero as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $\\hat{\\beta_1} = 0.5$ and $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = 0.0001$, then even though $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ is quite near $0$, we can still feel confident to say that the real parameter $\\beta_1$ is not 0, simply because our estimate $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ has such a small standard error/variation that it is very unlikely for our $\\beta_1$ to be 0.\n",
    "\n",

    "What I have described above is merely an intuition, talk is cheap and we need to use scientific methods to quantify it.

    "In the regression setting, we further take note that the **t-statistic** for each individual coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_i$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}i} = [t_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}}]_{(i+1) \\times (i+1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "***If our null hypothesis is really true, that*** $\\beta_1=0$***, then if we calculate our t-value to be 0, then we can understand it as the number of standard deviations that*** $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ ***is 0, which means that*** $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ ***is 0. This might be hard to reconcile at first, but if we see the formula of the t-statistics, and that by definition we set*** $\\beta_H=0$, then it is apparent that if $t_{\\hat{\\beta}}=0$, it forces the formula to become $t_{\\hat{\\beta}}=0=\\dfrac{\\hat{\\beta}-0}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta})} \\Longrightarrow \\hat{\\beta}=0$ ; even more concretely with an example, we replace $\\beta_{H}$ with our favorite **true population parameter** $\\beta_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$ with $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, then it just means that if $\\beta_1$ were really $0$, i.e. no relationship of $y$ and $x_1$, and if we also get $t_{\\hat{\\beta}_1}$to be 0 as well (To re-explain this part as a bit cumbersome). In which case we accept the null hypothesis; on the other hand, if our t-value is none-zero, it means that $\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\neq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we can conclude that greater the magnitude of $|t|$ ($t$ can be either positive or negative), the greater the evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The closer $t$ is to 0, the more likely there isn’t a significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "Well, we are only interested in the t-value of $\\hat{\\beta_1}$, which shows a value of 22. Quoting from [the author Jim Frost's book, he mentioned that](https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/t-tests-t-values-t-distributions-probabilities/) the tricky thing about t-values is that they are a unitless statistic, which makes them difficult to interpret on their own. We performed a t-test and it produced a t-value of 38.36. What does this t-value mean exactly? We know that the sample mean doesn’t equal the null hypothesis value because this t-value doesn’t equal zero. However, we don’t know how exceptional our value is if the null hypothesis is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we need to look at the P-values of the t-test. But before that, we look at t-distributions first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### T-Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "How T-distribution is formed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define our null and alternative hypothesis. In Simple Linear Regression, we simply set:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    & H_0: &\\beta_1 &= 0 \\\\\n",
    "    & H_{A}: &\\beta_1 &\\neq 0\n",
    "    \\end{aligned}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determine the test statistic that is most suitable for this parameter $\\beta_1$. Note that $\\beta_1$ is actually a constant and not a random variable, and we cannot know the distribution of $\\beta_1$ anyways since population is unknown. However, we can make use of the OLS estimator of $\\beta_1$ to draw inferences about it. So although we do not know $\\beta_1$ we are able to derive the sampling distribution of $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ which we have shown in the first section to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\sim N\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta},  \\hat{\\sigma}^2(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\right)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We could jolly well define $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ to be our test statistic and calculate $P(\\hat{\\beta_1} \\geq B_H)$ where $B_H$ is the hypothesis we want to test, if not for the fact that we do not even know the value of $\\sigma^2$ - which we desperately need because it appeared in the variance of $\\hat{\\beta_1}$. So this is the reason why we need to use an equivalent test statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t_{\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta_1}}} = \\dfrac{\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta_1}} - \\mathbf{\\beta_1}_H}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta_1}})} \\sim t(df)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if our $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ follows a normal distribution of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\sim N\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta},  \\hat{\\sigma}^2(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\right)$, then an equivalent distribution is $t_{\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta_1}}} \\sim t(df)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is clear that for any $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$, finding $P(a \\leq \\hat{\\beta_1} \\leq b)$ is the same as finding\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\dfrac{a}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})} \\leq t_{\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta_1}}} \\leq \\dfrac{b}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So finally, we have formed a sampling distribution of t-statistics, hinged on the assumption that ***our null hypothesis is true, $\\beta_1 = 0$ (this is important).***\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jim Statistics](https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/t-tests-t-values-t-distributions-probabilities/) provides an intuitive idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "### P-Values\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the resulting test statistic to calculate the p-value. As always, the p-value is the answer to the question \"how likely is it that we’d get a test statistic $t_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}}$ as extreme as we did if the null hypothesis were true?\" The p-value is determined by referring to a t-distribution with $m-(n+1) = m-2$ degrees of freedom where we recall that $m$ is the number of data, and $n$ is the number of variables. The $n+1$ is because we are actually fitting 2 parameters, so we add on 1 intercept term which has a dummy variable $x_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we make a decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the p-value is smaller than the significance level $\\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. We conclude \"there is sufficient evidence at the $\\alpha$ level to conclude that there is a linear relationship in the population between the predictor x and response y.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the p-value is larger than the significance level $\\alpha$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. We conclude \"there is not enough evidence at the $\\alpha$ level to conclude that there is a linear relationship in the population between the predictor x and response y.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us implement our p-values."

In other words, it is unlikely to observe such a substantial association between the predictor and the response due to chance, in the absence of any real association between the predictor and the response. We can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that $\\beta_1$ does not equal 0.

    "\n",
    "The Linear Algorithm that we used here simply uses matrix multiplication. We will also ignore the codes that are of constant time O(1). For example, `self.coef_=None` in the constructor is O(1) and we do not really wish to consider this in the *grand scheme of things.*\n",

Refer to this [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_mathematical_operations) for a handy helpsheet on the various time complexity for mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 37: `np.dot(X.T,X)` In the dot product, we transpose the m × n matrix to become n × m, this operation takes O(m × n) time because we are effectively performing two for loops.

In the end, the run time complexity of this Linear Regression Algorithm using Normal Equation is O(n²(m+n)). However, you noticed that there are two variables in the bigO notation, and you wonder if we can further reduce the bigO notation to a single variable? Well, if the number of variables is small, which means n is kept small and maybe constant, we can reduce the time complexity to O(m), however, if your variables are increasing, then your time complexity will explode if n → ∞.\n",
