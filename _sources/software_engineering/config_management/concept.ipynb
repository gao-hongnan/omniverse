    "With a well-structured and robust configuration system, you can centralize the\n",
    "settings and hyperparameters that govern your application. This allows you to\n",
    "avoid hard-coding values into your code, thereby improving its flexibility.\n",
    "Furthermore, it allows you to perform changes and updates more easily, without\n",
    "requiring modifications to the code itself. It is especially beneficial for\n",
    "machine learning applications, where experiments often involve tuning a\n",

    "\n",
    "What does it mean to compose configurations? Let's have a look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from __future__ import annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",

    "from typing_extensions import Annotated\n",
    "\n",

    "    std: List[float]\n",

    "    model_name: str\n",
    "    pretrained: bool\n",
    "    in_chans: Annotated[int, Field(strict=True, ge=1)]  # in_channels must be greater than or equal to 1\n",
    "    num_classes: Annotated[int, Field(strict=True, ge=1)]  # num_classes must be greater than or equal to 1\n",
    "    global_pool: str\n",
    "\n",

    "We call the above a **composition of sub-configs** where a well-organized config\n",
    "should allow you to modularize and re-use components across different settings,\n",
    "tasks, or stages of your system. You can have multiple sub-configs each\n",
    "describing a part of your system, and a master config that includes these\n",
    "sub-configs. Each sub-config can further be composed of even finer grains of\n",
    "sub-configs. This not only promotes reusability, but also enhances readability\n",
    "and maintainability of your configuration files. The only overhead is that you\n",
    "need to define the structure of your config classes, but this is a one-time\n",
    "effort that pays off in the long run. And for an initial poc, I don't suggest\n",
    "you to nest too deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Service Locator And Dependency Injection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this configuration design pattern, we can see the influence of two other\n",
    "underlying design patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Service Locator:** A pattern where an object (the service locator) knows\n",
    "    how to get hold of all the services that an application might need. So\n",
    "    instead of dependencies being pushed into a class, the class itself can pull\n",
    "    in what it needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Dependency Injection:** A pattern where dependencies are \"injected\" or\n",
    "    passed into the dependent object. This can be done through various ways such\n",
    "    as Constructor Injection (dependencies are provided through the class\n",
    "    constructor), Method Injection (dependencies are provided via methods), or\n",
    "    Property Injection (dependencies are set through properties).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these patterns aim to separate the creation of objects from the behavior\n",
    "of the system that uses them, thus promoting a cleaner and more modular\n",
    "structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, configuration management can serve as a mechanism for both service\n",
    "location and dependency injection. Let's revisit the definition of these two\n",
    "patterns but in the context of configuration management:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Service Locator:** The configuration can be seen as a service locator\n",
    "    because it holds the information needed to instantiate and retrieve various\n",
    "    services or components throughout the application. For instance, if you have\n",
    "    a database service configured in your application, the configuration file\n",
    "    holds the necessary parameters (like connection string, credentials etc.)\n",
    "    for your application to locate and connect to this service.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Dependency Injection:** At the same time, your configuration management\n",
    "    process can also enable dependency injection. The parameters from your\n",
    "    configuration can be injected into the components that need them. For\n",
    "    example, when a specific component of your application is created, the\n",
    "    necessary parameters are injected from the configuration, instead of the\n",
    "    component needing to fetch or know how to fetch those parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "By allowing the configuration to flow through your application, you're providing\n",
    "a mechanism for each component to get its dependencies (dependency injection),\n",
    "and you're also providing a way for components to locate the services they need\n",
    "(service locator). This leads to a more decoupled and maintainable codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see a pseudo code example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "State = Any\n",
    "\n",
    "class Pipeline:\n",
    "    def __init__(config: Config, state: State) -> None:\n",
    "        self.config = config\n",
    "        self.state = state\n",
    "\n",
    "    def run_trainer(self) -> None:\n",
    "        trainer.fit(\n",
    "            self.config.trainer,\n",
    "            self.config.dataloader,\n",
    "            self.config.optimizer,\n",
    "            self.config.scheduler,\n",
    "            self.config.callbacks,\n",
    "            state=self.state,\n",
    "        )\n",
    "\n",
    "    def run(self) -> None:\n",
    "        self.run_trainer()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Config For Different Stages/Evironments\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people distinguish between different types of configurations based on the\n",
    "stage or environment in which they are used. For example, you might have\n",
    "different configurations for development, testing, and production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one should know that production code is more or less a replica of the\n",
    "development code, with exceptions like the database connection string, logging,\n",
    "or environment variables. Often the config distinction is made at the deployment\n",
    "level rather than at the code level (i.e. a different config file to deploy to\n",
    "different environments).\n",
