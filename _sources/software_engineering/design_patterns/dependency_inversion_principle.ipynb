    "In the provided code example, we encounter a clear violation of the Dependency\n",
    "Inversion Principle (DIP), which affects the design's flexibility and\n",
    "maintainability. Let's dissect the relationship and dependency structure between\n",
    "the modules involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`CustomDataset`**: This is a **high-level** module designed to manage\n",
    "    dataset items and apply specific transformations to these items based on the\n",
    "    dataset's stage (training or testing). Its responsibilities include fetching\n",
    "    data items by index and applying the appropriate transformation functions to\n",
    "    prepare data for either training or testing scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`ImageClassificationTransforms` and `ImageSegmentationTransforms`**: These\n",
    "    **low-level** modules are responsible for providing the actual\n",
    "    transformation functions applicable to the dataset items. Each module\n",
    "    defines two methods, `get_train_transforms` and `get_test_transforms`, which\n",
    "    return transformation functions tailored to either training or testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In our code, the high level module depends on the low level module such that\n",
    "    the **creation** of `ImageClassificationTransforms` is done inside the\n",
    "    `CustomDataset` constructor. This leads to **high coupling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Direct Dependency**: Within the `CustomDataset` constructor, an instance\n",
    "    of `ImageClassificationTransforms` is directly instantiated. This direct\n",
    "    instantiation tightly couples the `CustomDataset` class to the\n",
    "    `ImageClassificationTransforms` class. As a result, `CustomDataset` is not\n",
    "    just dependent on the abstraction of transformation functions but on a\n",
    "    specific implementation of these functions provided by\n",
    "    `ImageClassificationTransforms`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Coupling and Flexibility Issues**: This coupling between the high-level\n",
    "    `CustomDataset` module and the low-level `ImageClassificationTransforms`\n",
    "    module restricts the flexibility of the dataset management system. Should\n",
    "    there be a need to apply a different set of transformations (e.g., using\n",
    "    `ImageSegmentationTransforms` for a segmentation task), the current design\n",
    "    requires modifying the `CustomDataset` class itself to change the\n",
    "    dependency. This design goes against the DIP's guidance, which suggests that\n",
    "    both high-level and low-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on\n",
    "    concrete implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The code looks fine but if we want to change the\n",
    "    `ImageClassificationTransforms` to `ImageSegmentationTransforms`, then we\n",
    "    have to change the `CustomDataset` code in two places:\n",
    "    -   Type hint of `ImageClassificationTransforms` to\n",
    "        `ImageSegmentationTransforms`;\n",
    "    -   Change manually the `ImageClassificationTransforms` to\n",
    "        `ImageSegmentationTransforms` in the constructor.\n",
    "-   Things soon get out of hand if we have a lot more of such dependencies, such\n",
    "    as `ObjectDetectionTransforms`, `ImageCaptioningTransforms`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correcting the Violation\n",
    "\n",
    "To adhere to the Dependency Inversion Principle, the design should be refactored\n",
    "such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Depend on Abstractions**: Both `CustomDataset` and the transformation\n",
    "   providing modules (`ImageClassificationTransforms`,\n",
    "   `ImageSegmentationTransforms`) should depend on a common abstraction (e.g.,\n",
    "   an interface or a base class) that defines the contract for transformation\n",
    "   functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Injection of Dependencies**: Instead of directly instantiating a specific\n",
    "   transformations class within the `CustomDataset` constructor, the\n",
    "   transformation provider should be passed in as a parameter (dependency\n",
    "   injection). This approach allows the `CustomDataset` to remain agnostic of\n",
    "   the concrete implementation of transformation functions, enhancing\n",
    "   modularity, flexibility, and the ease of testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ./assets/uml.drawio.svg\n",
    "---\n",
    "name: UML Diagram.\n",
    "---\n",

    "A very ugly UML diagram.\n",

    "\n",
    "More concretely, we can create an interface `Transforms` that will be\n",
    "implemented by `ImageClassificationTransforms`, `ImageSegmentationTransforms`,\n",
    "etc. Then, we can pass the `Transforms` object to the `CustomDataset`\n",
    "constructor `__init__` method. This way, the `CustomDataset` will depend on the\n",
    "`Transforms` interface and not on the `ImageClassificationTransforms` class.\n",
    "This way, we can change the `ImageClassificationTransforms` to\n",
    "`ImageSegmentationTransforms` without changing the `CustomDataset` code. This is\n",
    "called **Dependency Inversion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abstraction does not depend on details simply mean the abstract class should\n",
    "not hold any implementation. The implementation should be done in the concrete\n",
    "class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in my `Transforms(ABC)` abstract class/interface below, I have two\n",
    "abstract methods `get_train_transforms` and `get_test_transforms`. These methods\n",
    "are not implemented in the abstract class. They are implemented in the concrete\n",
    "class `ImageClassificationTransforms`. This is the second rule in **Dependency\n",
    "Inversion Principle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the high level module `CustomDataset`, I have a constructor `__init__` that\n",
    "takes in a `Transforms` abstract class/interface. Now my `CustomDataset` depends\n",
    "on the `Transforms` abstraction and not on the `ImageClassificationTransforms`\n",
    "class. This is the first rule in **Dependency Inversion Principle**.\n",
    "Furthermore, if you were to switch your task from image classification to image\n",
    "segmentation, you can simply change the `ImageClassificationTransforms` to\n",
    "`ImageSegmentationTransforms` without changing the `CustomDataset` code as you\n",
    "are not **creating/coupled** to the `ImageClassificationTransforms` class."

    "code (i.e., how classes and modules are related to each other), DI is about how\n",
    "the dependencies are provided to an object at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "DIP is primarily concerned with the design and static structure of code, guiding\n",
    "developers on how to write modules that remain as independent as possible from\n",
    "the implementations of the modules they rely on.\n",
    "\n",
    "DI, on the other hand, is a design pattern that **implements** the Dependency\n",
    "Inversion Principle. It's about the actual mechanics of providing an object with\n",
    "the outside resources (dependencies) it needs to perform its functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DIP advocates for a particular structure of code relationships to\n",
    "reduce the coupling between high-level and low-level modules, while DI is a\n",
    "practical way to achieve this by handling the creation and binding of\n",
    "dependencies externally. Adhering to DIP will allow your software to become more\n",
    "modular, easier to test, and more maintainable.\n",
