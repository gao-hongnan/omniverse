    "\n",
    "2. **Single Item in Memory**: At any point in time, only the current row being\n",

    "   if no longer referenced, keeping the memory footprint low.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stateful Iteration**: The generator function maintains its state between\n",
    "   each yield. It knows where it left off (which line it yielded last) and\n",

    "The `yield` statement in Python is probably what defines the generator\n",
    "functions, let's take a look.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `yield` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A **generator function** is a **function** that, when called, returns a\n",
    "**generator iterator**. This is achieved by including at least one `yield`\n",
    "statement in the function definition. **Unlike a `return` statement, which\n",
    "terminates a function entirely and sends a value back to the caller, `yield`\n",
    "pauses the function, saving its state for continuation when next required.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a generator function calls `yield`, the function execution is **paused**,\n",
    "and a value is sent to the caller. However, the function's **local variables and\n",
    "execution state are saved internally**. The next time the generator is advanced\n",
    "(using the `next()` function or a for loop, for example), execution resumes from\n",
    "exactly where it was left off, immediately after the `yield` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "More concretely (and verbosely), upon encountering a `yield` statement, the\n",
    "function's current state is preserved or \"frozen\". This means that local\n",
    "variables, the instruction pointer, and even the state of the evaluation stack\n",
    "are saved. Consequently, when `.next()` is called again, the function resumes\n",
    "precisely from where it left off, as if `yield` were a pause in execution rather\n",
    "than an interruption. This mechanism allows generator functions to produce a\n",
    "sequence of values over time, providing an efficient way to work with data\n",
    "streams or large datasets without requiring all data to be loaded into memory\n",
    "simultaneously[^2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, when a generator function is called, the actual arguments are bound to\n",
    "function-local formal argument names in the usual way, but no code in the body\n",
    "of the function is executed. Instead a generator-iterator object is returned;\n",
    "this conforms to the iterator protocol, so in particular can be used in\n",
    "for-loops in a natural way. Note that when the intent is clear from context, the\n",
    "unqualified name \"generator\" may be used to refer either to a generator-function\n",
    "or a generator-iterator[^2].\n",

    "`.__next__()` method (or its equivalent, `next(gen)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first call `gen.__next__()` or `next(gen)`, the generator starts\n",
    "executing up to the first `yield` statement, yielding the value of `count`\n",
    "(which is `1`). At this point, since you're not using `.send()` to advance the\n",
    "generator but `.__next__()` instead, the value received by the `yield`\n",
    "expression is `None`. This is the default behavior when the generator is\n",
    "advanced without explicitly sending a value. The generator then proceeds to the\n",
    "`if received is not None:` check. Since `received` is `None`, the condition\n",
    "fails, and execution moves to the `else:` clause, incrementing `count`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when you call `gen.send(5)`, you're explicitly sending a value (`5`)\n",
    "into the generator, which resumes execution right after the `yield` statement,\n",
    "with `received` now being `5`. This means the `if received is not None:`\n",
    "condition succeeds, and the code inside that block executes, setting `count` to\n",
    "`5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify, here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Call with `.__next__()`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The generator yields `1`, and `received` is implicitly `None` because no\n",
    "      value was sent into the generator. The `else:` clause is executed,\n",
    "      incrementing `count`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Call with `.send(5)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `received` is set to `5`, so the `if received is not None:` condition is\n",
    "      true and `count` is set to `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subsequent Iteration in the For Loop**:\n",
    "    - The for loop implicitly calls `.__next__()` on each iteration, not\n",
    "      `.send()`, so no new value is sent into the generator. Therefore,\n",
    "      `received` is `None` again for each iteration within the loop, and the\n",
    "      generator simply increments `count` until it exceeds `max`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism allows the generator to either accept new values from the outside\n",
    "via `.send(value)` or continue its own internal logic, incrementing `count`,\n",
    "when advanced with `.__next__()` or `next(gen)`, where no external value is\n",
