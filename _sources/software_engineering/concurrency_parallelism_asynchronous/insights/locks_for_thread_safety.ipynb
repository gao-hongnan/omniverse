    "$2,000,000$ or $3,000,000$ sometimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Does This Happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "The line `counter.increment(1)` seems atomic but is actually a shorthand for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read:** Retrieve the current value of `counter`:\n",
    "   `current_value = counter.count`\n",
    "2. **Add:** Increment the value by 1: `new_value = current_value + 1`\n",
    "3. **Write:** Store the new value back to `counter`: `counter.count = new_value`\n",
    "\n",
    "If the OS pre-empts a thread **after** reading but **before** writing, another\n",
    "thread might read the same initial value, leading to lost updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pan out a scenario where this can happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Thread 1: `thread_1_current_value = counter.count = 0`\n",
    "2. Thread 2: `thread_2_current_value = counter.count = 0`. This is called a\n",
    "   _context switch_.\n",
    "3. Thread 2: `thread_2_new_value = thread_2_current_value + 1 = 1`\n",
    "4. Thread 2: `counter.count = thread_2_new_value = 1`.\n",
    "5. Thread 1: `thread_1_new_value = thread_1_current_value + 1 = 1`\n",
    "6. Thread 1: `counter.count = thread_1_new_value = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see thread 2 interrupted thread 1 after thread 1 read the value of\n",
    "`counter` but before it could write the new value back. Then even though the\n",
    "counter should be 2, it is 1 because thread 1 overwrote it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lock\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's threading module offers a suite of tools to prevent issues like data\n",
    "races and data structure corruption in multithreaded environments. Among these,\n",
    "the `Lock` class stands out as a particularly useful and straightforward option.\n",
    "It implements a mutual-exclusion lock, commonly known as a mutex.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating a `Lock` into the `Counter` class, you can safeguard its\n",
    "current value from concurrent access by multiple threads. The lock ensures that\n",
    "only one thread can access the protected data at any given moment. To manage the\n",
    "lock efficiently, you can utilize Python's with statement, which handles both\n",
    "the acquisition and release of the lock automatically.\n",
