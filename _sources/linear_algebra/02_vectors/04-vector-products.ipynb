    "\n",
    "In this introductory section, we'll take our first look at the concept of the\n",

    "\n",
    "The dot product, also known as the scalar product, is a way to multiply two\n",

    "the dot product serves as a building block for understanding how data points\n",
    "relate to each other in feature (embedding) space. It's also a stepping stone\n",
    "towards more advanced concepts in analytical geometry, where the dot product\n",
    "plays a crucial role in defining angles and distances between vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product)[^dot_product]\n",

    "##### Proof of Geometric Definition and The Law of Cosines\n",
    "\n",
    "For readers keen on _proofs_, the geometric definition of the dot product can be\n",
    "derived from the\n",
    "[**Law of Cosines**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Scalar projections\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Scalar projection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_projection) offer a\n",
    "concise way to understand the geometric interpretation of the dot product by\n",
    "illustrating how one vector projects onto another. For the scalar projection of\n",
    "vector $\\mathbf{a}$ onto vector $\\mathbf{b}$, we are essentially looking at the\n",
    "length of the part of $\\mathbf{a}$ that aligns with the direction of\n",
    "$\\mathbf{b}$, assuming both vectors originate from the same point. This length,\n",
    "known as the scalar projection, can be positive, negative, or zero, reflecting\n",
    "the orientation of $\\mathbf{a}$ relative to $\\mathbf{b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the scalar projection of $\\mathbf{a}$ onto $\\mathbf{b}$, denoted\n",
    "as $\\text{proj}_{\\mathbf{b}} \\mathbf{a}$, is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{proj}_{\\mathbf{b}} \\mathbf{a} = \\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}}{\\|\\mathbf{b}\\|} ,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}$ is the dot product of $\\mathbf{a}$ and\n",
    "$\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\|\\mathbf{b}\\|$ is the magnitude of $\\mathbf{b}$. This\n",
    "calculation reveals the component of $\\mathbf{a}$ that is in the same direction\n",
    "as $\\mathbf{b}$, providing a quantitative measure of how much $\\mathbf{a}$\n",
    "'extends' in the direction of $\\mathbf{b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how does this scalar projection relate to the dot product and the angle\n",
    "between the vectors? Here are a few key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measurement of Alignment**: The scalar projection of vector $\\mathbf{a}$\n",
    "   onto vector $\\mathbf{b}$ quantifies the extent to which $\\mathbf{a}$ aligns\n",
    "   along the direction of $\\mathbf{b}$. This alignment is crucial for\n",
    "   understanding the dot product geometrically because the dot product,\n",
    "   $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\|\\|\\mathbf{b}\\|\\cos\\theta$,\n",
    "   essentially measures how much of $\\mathbf{a}$ lies in the direction of\n",
    "   $\\mathbf{b}$ when considering the angle $\\theta$ between them. Scalar\n",
    "   projection makes this concept tangible by providing a specific length value\n",
    "   that represents this alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cosine of the Angle**: The role of $\\cos\\theta$ in the dot product formula\n",
    "   is pivotal because it adjusts the magnitude of the product based on the angle\n",
    "   between the two vectors. When $\\theta$ is small (vectors more aligned),\n",
    "   $\\cos\\theta$ is closer to 1, indicating a strong positive projection (i.e.,\n",
    "   $\\mathbf{a}$ largely points in the same direction as $\\mathbf{b}$). When\n",
    "   $\\theta$ is 90 degrees, $\\cos\\theta$ is 0, reflecting orthogonal vectors with\n",
    "   no projection onto each other. This relationship between $\\cos\\theta$ and the\n",
    "   scalar projection encapsulates the geometric interpretation of the dot\n",
    "   product as a measure of vector alignment and interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Understanding Vector Magnitudes and Direction**: Scalar projections and the\n",
    "   dot product together provide a comprehensive view of how vectors interact\n",
    "   based not just on their direction but also on their magnitudes. The dot\n",
    "   product takes into account both the size (magnitude) of the vectors and their\n",
    "   directional relationship, offering a single scalar value that encapsulates\n",
    "   both aspects. Through scalar projection, we see the practical application of\n",
    "   these principles, where the magnitude of the projection tells us how much one\n",
    "   vector extends in the direction of another, grounded in the vectors'\n",
    "   magnitudes and the angle between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sign of the Dot Product is Determined by the Angle in between Two Vectors\n",

    "The **dot product**[^dot_product] fulfills the following properties if\n",
    "$\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$ are real\n",
    "[vectors](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)>) and\n",
    "$\\lambda$ is a [scalar](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics)>).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} ,$ which follows\n",
    "    from the definition ($\\theta$ is the angle between **a** and **b**):\n",
    "    $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\left\\| \\mathbf{a} \\right\\| \\left\\| \\mathbf{b} \\right\\| \\cos \\theta = \\left\\| \\mathbf{b} \\right\\| \\left\\| \\mathbf{a} \\right\\| \\cos \\theta = \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} .$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[Distributive over vector addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c}) = \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} .$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **[Bilinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_form):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot ( \\lambda \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c} ) = \\lambda ( \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} ) + ( \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} ) .$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **[Scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    $( \\lambda_1 \\mathbf{a} ) \\cdot ( \\lambda_2 \\mathbf{b} ) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 ( \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} ) .$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Not [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is because the dot product between a scalar value computed from\n",
    "    $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}$ and a vector $\\mathbf{c}$ is not defined,\n",
    "    which means that the expressions involved in the associative property,\n",
    "    $(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}) \\cdot \\mathbf{c}$ and\n",
    "    $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{c})$, are both ill-defined. Note\n",
    "    however that the previously mentioned scalar multiplication property is\n",
    "    sometimes called the \"associative law for scalar and dot product\" or one can\n",
    "    say that \"the dot product is associative with respect to scalar\n",
    "    multiplication\" because\n",
    "    $\\lambda (\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}) = (\\lambda \\mathbf{a}) \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\lambda \\mathbf{b})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **[Orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Two non-zero vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are _orthogonal_ if and\n",
    "    only if $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **No [cancellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellation_property):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unlike multiplication of ordinary numbers, where if $ab=ac$ then _b_ always\n",
    "    equals _c_ unless _a_ is zero, the dot product does not obey the\n",
    "    cancellation law.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **[Product Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    If $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are\n",
    "    [differentiable functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function),\n",
    "    then the derivative, denoted by a prime ' of $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}$\n",
    "    is given by the rule\n",
    "    $(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b})' = \\mathbf{a}' \\cdot \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}'$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let two vectors $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ be in a field $\\mathbb{F}^D$, then\n",

    "\n",
    "$$|\\mathbf{v}^\\top \\mathbf{w}| \\leq \\Vert \\mathbf{v} \\Vert \\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert$$\n",
    "\n",
    "holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This inequality establishes an **upper bound** for the dot product of two\n",
    "vectors, indicating that the absolute value of their dot product cannot exceed\n",
    "the multiplication of their individual norms. It's important to note that this\n",
    "inequality reaches a point of equality only under two conditions: either both\n",
    "vectors are the zero vector $\\mathbf{0}$, or one vector is a scalar multiple of\n",
    "the other, denoted as $\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{w}$. This principle\n",
    "underscores the inherent relationship between the geometric alignment of vectors\n",
    "and their magnitudes, providing a foundational concept in vector analysis and\n",
    "linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition for equality,\n",
    "$|\\mathbf{v}^\\top \\mathbf{w}| = \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|$, occurs precisely\n",
    "when $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ are linearly dependent, meaning one is a\n",
    "scalar multiple of the other ($\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{w}$). This situation\n",
    "represents vectors pointing in the same or exactly opposite directions, where\n",
    "their geometric alignment maximizes the dot product relative to their\n",
    "magnitudes. This specific case illustrates the tight bound provided by the\n",
    "inequality and its geometric interpretation as the projection of one vector onto\n",
    "another.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wonder why when $\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{w}$ implies equality\n",
    "mathematically, it is apparent if you do a substitution as such\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\mathbf{v}^\\top \\mathbf{w}| = |\\lambda \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{w}| = \\lambda |\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{w}| = \\lambda \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2 = \\lambda \\|\\mathbf{w}\\| \\|\\mathbf{w}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|$$\n",
