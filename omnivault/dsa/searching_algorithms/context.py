"""
The context module in the omnivault.dsa.searching_algorithms package. It defines
the SearchContext class, which acts as the primary interface for executing
search strategies in the Strategy Design Pattern.

The SearchContext class holds a reference to a search strategy and delegates the
searching task to it. This allows for dynamic swapping of search algorithms at
runtime, adhering to the principles of the Strategy Pattern.
