"""
This module, part of the omnivault.dsa.searching_algorithms package, implements
various concrete search strategies as per the Strategy Design Pattern. Each
class in this module defines a specific search algorithm, like linear search or
binary search.

These strategies are designed to be used interchangeably by the SearchContext
class in context.py, demonstrating the flexibility and decoupling offered by the
Strategy Pattern.
