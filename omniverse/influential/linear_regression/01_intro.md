In this chapter, we discuss linear regression, which is a very widely used
method for predicting a real-valued output (also called the dependent variable
or target) $y \in \mathbb{R}$, given a vector of real-valued inputs (also called
independent variables, explanatory variables, or covariates)
$\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^D$. The key property of the model is that the
expected value of the output is assumed to be a linear function of the input,
$\mathbb{E}[y \mid \boldsymbol{x}]=\boldsymbol{w}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}$, which
makes the model easy to interpret, and easy to fit to data {cite}`pml1Book`.

There are two views to solving Linear Regression, we will focus on the
probabilistic aspect of it and leave the geometry/linear algebra interpretation
for further readings.

Regression in itself is a very broad topic, the analysis in itself can be made
as a course/book. Therefore, I will just touch and go on the important parts of
it.
