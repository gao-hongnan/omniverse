The tissue taken from the biopsy will then be sent to a lab and be examined by a pathologist, a report will be written if cancerous cells are spotted or not and be sent to the specialist to further explain the results to the patient. However, there may be [disagreements](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-biopsy/about/pac-20384812) whereby the pathologist report shows there are no signs of cancerous cells, while radiologist may disagree as he/she might find suspicious lesions from the mammogram/CT/MRI scans. This can happen if the biopsy taken is only on the benign cells and if there is dispute, a more thorough of biopsy may be performed again.\n","\n","---\n","\n","Although our aim in Machine Learning is to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant, we should bear in mind that we are not trying to dispute the expertise of the doctors/pathologists/radiologists. Instead, we develop models to aid their understanding, and also to come up with a more systematic benchmark for one to refer to. More concretely, the dataset has features that are computed from a digitized image from **FNA**, and each observation describes statistics/characteristics of the cell nucleus. There are 10 base features, and 3 different measurements are taken for each feature, namely, the **mean, standard error and the \"worst/largest\"**.

If we need to explain our model to our business stakeholders, then it is a good idea to choose a model that can be interpreted well, models like Logistic Regression with Lasso may be a good choice as the model itself has better interpretation, and with lasso we can reduce the number of features. If we only care about our model's ability to predict, then interpretability may not be so important and we may choose a model that performs well, but the weights may be more difficult to understand. \n","    - Time and Space Complexity: Practically speaking, we need to strike a balance between the speed of the training and the performance measure of the model. \n","    - Data Centric vs Model Centric: From the one and only Andrew Ng[^data centric] we understood that data plays a critical role in the Machine Learning world.\n","\n","[^data centric]: https://analyticsindiamag.com/big-data-to-good-data-andrew-ng-urges-ml-community-to-be-more-data-centric-and-less-model-centric/"],"id":"74baf815-1a11-4cb6-9479-b01237d78b1f"}]}
