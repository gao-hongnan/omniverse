    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of\n",
    "the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not\n",
    "use the same element twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can return the answer in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be solved by using a\n",
    "**[hash map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)** to store the numbers in\n",
    "the `nums` array as keys and their indices as values. By doing so, we can\n",
    "achieve a $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ look-up time for checking if a number exists in our\n",
    "array. For each number in the `nums` array, we calculate the difference between\n",
    "the `target` and that number, and then check if this difference exists in our\n",
    "hash map. If it does, we have found our two numbers that add up to the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each given input will have exactly **one solution**.\n",
    "- The **same element** cannot be used twice in the pair.\n",
    "- The **order** of indices in the output does not matter.\n",
    "- All the elements in the `nums` array are **integers**.\n",
    "- The `target` is also an **integer**.\n",
    "- The `nums` array will at least have **two elements** (since we are looking\n",
    "    for a pair).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's assumed that the `nums` array size is in the range of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    2 \\leq \\text{nums.length} \\leq 10^4.\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each element in `nums` array is an integer in the range of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    -10^9 \\leq \\text{nums[i]} \\leq 10^9.\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `target` is an integer in the range of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    -10^9 \\leq \\text{target} \\leq 10^9.\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is only **one valid answer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Constraints for?\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming problems, **constraints** are given to define the scope and\n",
    "limits of the problem. They help to determine the feasible approaches and\n",
    "solutions for the problem by providing information about the range and\n",
    "characteristics of the input data. They help us to anticipate the worst-case\n",
    "scenarios that our algorithm should be able to handle without leading to\n",
    "inefficiencies or failures, like time limit exceeded or memory limit exceeded\n",
    "errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the problem at hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The constraint on `nums.length` (i.e.,\n",
    "    $2 \\leq \\text{nums.length} \\leq 10^4$) specifies the minimum and maximum\n",
    "    size of the `nums` array that our algorithm needs to handle. Knowing this,\n",
    "    we can evaluate whether our solution would scale efficiently for the largest\n",
    "    possible input size. In this case, a solution with a time complexity of\n",
    "    $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ or $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ would likely be acceptable, but\n",
    "    a solution with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ may not be efficient\n",
    "    enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The constraints on the individual elements of `nums` and on `target` (i.e.,\n",
    "    $-10^9 \\leq \\text{nums[i]} \\leq 10^9$ and\n",
    "    $-10^9 \\leq \\text{target}\n",
    "  \\leq 10^9$) let us know the range of values that\n",
    "    these variables can take. These constraints are important to take into\n",
    "    account when considering possible edge cases and overflow issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The specification that there is only one valid answer helps to simplify the\n",
    "    problem by indicating that we don't need to consider scenarios where there\n",
    "    might be multiple pairs of numbers in `nums` that add up to `target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test Case 1: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`, Return: `[0, 1]`\n",

    "    - Check if `7` is in the hash map. It's not, so add `{2:0}` to the hash map.\n",
    "    - For the second element `7`, calculate `9 - 7 = 2`.\n",
    "    - Check if `2` is in the hash map. It is, so return the current index `1`\n",

    "## Theoretical Best Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical best time complexity for this problem is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, where \n",
    "$n$ is the length of the `nums` array. This is because the most efficient \n",

    "The theoretical best (auxiliary) space complexity for this problem is\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This\n",

    "## Space-Time Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
