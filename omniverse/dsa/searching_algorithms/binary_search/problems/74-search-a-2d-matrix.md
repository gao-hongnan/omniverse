### Intuition

This is a really simple problem if you have solved the basic 1D binary search
problem. The only difference is that you have to perform binary search on each
row of the matrix.

Of course, brute force works just as easily, but since the time complexity
constraint is on the $\log$ scale, we can't afford to do that since looping over
a $m \times n$ matrix takes $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ time. But if we just do binary
search on each row, we can get $\mathcal{O}(m \log n)$ time, which is much
better.

The time complexity of searching in a 2D matrix can be either $m \log n$ or
$\log(mn)$ depending on how the binary search is applied.

If you are applying binary search on each row of the matrix individually, the
time complexity would be $m \log n$. This is because for each of the $m$ rows,
you perform a binary search operation that has a time complexity of $\log n$,
assuming n is the number of columns.

However, if you treat the 2D matrix as a flattened 1D array, the time complexity
of the binary search becomes $\log(mn)$. This is because you're now performing a
single binary search operation over $mn$ elements. To convert between a 2D index
and a 1D index in this case, you can use the formula $index = row * n + column$.

The advantage of this latter approach is that it takes advantage of the fact
that the entire 2D matrix is sorted, not just individual rows or columns, so
you're using more of the information available to you to make the search faster.
This is why you often see $\log(mn)$ used as the time complexity for searching a
sorted 2D matrix.
