Testing in machine learning is a bit different from traditional software
testing. Here we just give an intuition on _how_ different it is.
[Eugene Yan](https://eugeneyan.com/) has written a series of articles on testing
in machine learning.

## Deterministic vs. Stochastic Systems

Many models in machine learning and deep learning are stochastic.
