    abstract        = {In this paper, we present a rigorous mathematical examination of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and their autoregressive self-supervised learning mechanisms. We begin by defining natural language space and knowledge space, which are two key concepts for understanding the dimensionality reduction process in GPT-based large language models (LLMs). By exploring projection functions and their inverses, we establish a framework for analyzing the language generation capabilities of these models. We then investigate the GPT representation space, examining its implications for the modelsâ€™ approximation properties. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges of GPT models and their learning mechanisms, considering trade-offs between complexity and generalization, as well as the implications of incomplete inverse projection functions. Our findings demonstrate that GPT models possess the capability to encode knowledge into low-dimensional vectors through their autoregressive self-supervised learning mechanism. This comprehensive analysis provides a solid mathematical foundation for future advancements in GPT-based LLMs, promising advancements in natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering due to improved understanding and optimization of model training and performance.},
