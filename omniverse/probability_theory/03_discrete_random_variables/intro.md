This chapter discuss discrete random variables. We will start with the
definition of a discrete random variable and then discuss the probability mass
function (PMF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF). We will then
discuss the expected value and variance of a discrete random variable.

We will then turn to some common discrete distributions.
