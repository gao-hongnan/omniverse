# Application: Learning Theory

See [Learning Theory section](../../../machine_learning/fundamentals/learning_theory/concept.md)
for a more detailed discussion on the learning theory.

In practice, we are often told that if you increase the number of data (or samples), the performance of the model will improve. But why is this so besides the intuition that the
model gets to "see" more diverse samples, and therefore can "learn" better? In this section, we will discuss the theoretical justification for this claim.
