# Application: Learning Theory

See
[Learning Theory section](../../../influential/learning_theory/02_concept.md)
for a more detailed discussion on the learning theory.

In practice, we are often told that if you increase the number of data (or
samples), the performance of the model will improve. But why is this so besides
the intuition that the model gets to "see" more diverse samples, and therefore
can "learn" better? In this section, we will discuss the theoretical
justification for this claim.
