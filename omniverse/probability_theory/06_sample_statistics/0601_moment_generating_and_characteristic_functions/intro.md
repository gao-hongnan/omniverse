# Moment Generating and Characteristic Functions

Moment generating functions are functions that generate moments (i.e., expected values of powers of a random variable) of a random variable. They are defined as the expected value of the exponential function raised to the product of the random variable and a constant. Moment generating functions allow us to determine the moments of a random variable, and therefore, its distribution.

Characteristic functions are similar to moment generating functions, but they use complex exponentials instead of simple exponentials. They are defined as the expected value of the complex exponential function raised to the product of the random variable and a constant. Characteristic functions provide a way to study the behavior of a random variable, especially its limit properties, and can be used to establish various limit theorems in probability theory.

Overall, moment generating functions and characteristic functions are important tools in probability theory and mathematical statistics, and they have a wide range of applications in many areas of science and engineering.
